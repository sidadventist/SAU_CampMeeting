<p>We speak of the realms of the blest,<br />That country so bright and so fair,<br />And oft are its glories confessed,<br />But what must it be to be there! <br />We speak of it streets of pure gold,<br />Its walls decked with jewels so rare,<br />Its wonders and pleasures untold,<br />But what must it be to be there.</p>
<p>We speak of its freedom from sin,<br />From sorrow, temptation and care,<br />From trials without and within,<br />But what must it be to be there!<br />We speak of its service of love,<br />And robes which the glorified wear,<br />The church of the firstborn above,<br />But what must it be to be there!</p>
<p>Do Thou, midst temptation and woe,<br />For heaven my spirit prepare,<br />And shortly I also shall know,<br />And feel what it is to be there;<br />Then o&rsquo;er the bright fields we shall roam,<br />In glory celestial and fair, <br />With saints and with angels at home,<br />And Jesus himself will be there.</p>
