<p><strong>Lesson Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Discuss the meaning of Church Governance? </em></strong>
<p>In general, church governance implies a strategic organization of the church for the purpose of fulfilling its mission. Dederen defines it as &ldquo;a set of rules and regulations designed to facilitate the task of the church and the work of those involved in it.&rdquo; The need for such rules and regulations is due to awareness of trends affecting the church&rsquo;s reason of existence. This paper argues that church governance is more inclined towards mission fulfilment rather than restrictive measures that seek to deprive God&rsquo;s people of their religious privileges.</p>
<p>Church governance and policies address questions of existence such as: What constitutes a church in terms of organization and order? How does a church functions in terms of duties and decision making? Who participates in special ministries? What procedures should be followed when making decisions or resolving disputes? How should people conduct themselves within and without the church organization? Whenever and wherever God&rsquo;s people are concerned about about mission fulfilment, practical questions such as these cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>This study seeks to: strengthen the church&rsquo;s consciousness on self-understanding; clarify its sense of mission; unite believers on beliefs and practices; clarify its mission methods, clear its objectives and purposes. It also seeks to restore gospel order and unity in matters of interpretation and application of church policies. By so doing, the church may be revitalized toward fulfilment of its mission-mandate. To accomplish such purposes, some guiding principles are drawn from the Bible, the Spirit of Prophecy, our history, and denominational policies, so as to discourage unilaterally departure from what has been agreed upon by the world Church.</p>
<p>The following sections addresses the essence of church governance by examining biblical bases about its origin, various forms of church governance, the role of Church policies for post-modern Christians in general and for Seventh-day Adventists in particular.</p>
<p><strong>Origin of Church Governance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss the following Questions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) <em>When do you think the issue of Church Governance started? </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> (2) Who do you think established it and for what purpose? </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for systemic governance and policies is as old as creation itself. The practice can be traced from God&rsquo;s governance of the universe. God set some laws and rules that regulate the solar system, govern angels in heaven, humanity on planet earth, and nature in its entirety. The principles of God&rsquo;s governance include love, goodness, mercy, morality, and truth. Isaiah declares that Lucifer was the first created being to rebel against God&rsquo;s governance system and policies in heaven. That rebellion began as a cherished idea within his heart (Isa 14:12-15). It then grew and gained sympathisers from some angels, and eventually escalated into open conflict against God. John claims,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And war broke out in heaven, Michael and His angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the devil, and Satan, who deceives the whole world, he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him&rdquo; (Rev 12:7-9).</p>
<p>Since then, Satan seeks to destroy God&rsquo;s church by planting seeds of rebellion within church members. At family level, he leads members to abuse entrusted authority, or to rebel against instituted authority. Likewise, God&rsquo;s church suffers from similar abuse of power, and/or rebellion against authorities. On the other hand, God seeks to restore order, peace, love, and harmony among His children.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Responses to Church Governance</strong></p>
<p>The conflict between Satan ad God is technically known as &ldquo;the great controversy.&rdquo; At the heart of such conflict, are two possible responses: (1) compliance to divine authority, or (2) rebellion against it. There is no one who stands neutral. A person either complies or rebels against God&rsquo;s governing system. Therefore, the issue of church governance and policy should not be taken lightly by God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p><em>Compliance to </em><em>God&rsquo;s </em><em>Authority</em>: This aspect implies submission to God&rsquo;s Word. It begins with passive submission to rules and orders from any authority. For Christians, it is punctuated by doing or avoiding what the Lord says. God&rsquo;s Word should be taken by faith. Noah and Abraham are among good examples of such practice. They believed God&rsquo;s word against all odds.</p>
<p><em>R</em><em>ebellio</em><em>n against Authority</em>: Sometimes rebellion begins with passive resistance to any form of authority, and later matures to open hostility against God&rsquo;s supreme authority and policies. Governing authorities may be at family level, communal level, or church level. Rebellion against God&rsquo;s authority can result from selfish ambitions informed by egoistic tendencies (Isa14:12-15). It can also emanate from pride deeply rooted in excessive consciousness of one&rsquo;s refined intellect, abundant material blessings, or position power. Lucifer was extremely intelligent (Eze 28:3-7). He was also endowed with much glory, and was highly positioned as a covering cherub that stood in the glory of God&rsquo;s presence (Eze 28:12-15). He became too conscious of his natural endowments and was obsessed with position power. Eventually, he rebelled against God&rsquo;s governance system. In short, he failed to manage endowed glory.</p>
<p>Rebellion against authority can be also necessitated by sympathizing with the arrogant. Such was the experience of lost angels from heaven (Rev 12:3-4). In Eden, Adam and Eve rebelled due to subtle deception and peer pressure (Gen 3:1-4). Likewise, all generations that came after Adam and Eve, are vulnerable to satan&rsquo;s deception and rebellion against established biblical standards of life.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> If Church governance is understood properly and practiced accordingly, strained relationships heal fast, there will be gospel order, and mission will be accomplished more effectively. In Eden, God established a sound governance system for humanity and all creation (Gen 1:26-30; 2:15-25). Later, Satan deceived Adam and Eve to rebel God&rsquo;s governance system and to violate His policies (Gen 3:1-4). Violation of God&rsquo;s policies left them in discord and dismay. Their relationship with all creation became sour. Ultimately, the whole creation lost relational harmony, and all forms of misery crept in including death.</p>
<p>The General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist appeals therefore,</p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p>God designed governance for a universe of harmony and creative energy. He gave us this world to govern! Let&rsquo;s explore together how we can build on God&rsquo;s ways to govern our Christian organizations with His values and methods. Let&rsquo;s rediscover His power of leading in ways that are humble, transparent, and authentic. Can we instill the character of Christ in all of this and return &ldquo;governance to what God envisioned in Eden?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compliance to the biblical model of church governance unites the church towards mission fulfilment, and thus, preparing them for eternal life to come.</p>
<p>Church governance seeks to safeguard the interests of God&rsquo;s work as the church grows. Depending on how it is understood and practiced, it can either facilitate, or hinder mission fulfilment. Such assumption leads us to the subject of various theories that generally inform the practice of church governance within Christianity as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Theories/Forms of Church Governance</strong></p>
<p>The Old Testament depicts at least three forms of church governance.</p>
<p>(1) <em>theocracy</em>: divine government in which God Himself directly governed, ruled, or constantly spoke to His people even through some selected agents like priests, prophets, or patriarchs. Such agents would receive direct word, or counsel, or judgments from God for the benefit of God&rsquo;s children (Deut 1:9-18). In some cases, God spoke through the breastplate of the high priest by means of the Urim and the Thumim (Exo 28:30; Lev 8:8; Num 27:21; Deut 33:8). In that form of governance, the Torah was the church policy. It embraced the law which was the constitution for the children of Israel, and the ordinances that informed their religious practices.</p>
<p>(2) <em>democracy</em>: government of people by the people according to opinions of people. In Greco-Roman times, such form was technically known as <em>laodocea</em>.</p>
<p>(3) <em>autocracy</em>: This is a kind of dictatorship in which one person rules over all people and imposes own will and desires over others. God&rsquo;s church must never be governed in such a way. During the era of prophets and kings, the children of Israel rejected theocracy in favour of such kind of governance.</p>
<p>In general Christian practices, there are four major theories with regard to church governance. Surprisingly, each theory or form claims scriptural basis.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Episcopal System</em>: The governance of the church by bishops (<em>episkopoi</em>) whose authority is regarded to have been directly and exclusively entrusted by Christ, as successors of the apostles. In this system, supreme authority rests on the bishops, then followed by priests, and finally deacons.</li>
<li><em>Congregationalism System</em>: This form of church governance stresses the role of the local congregation as the seat of supreme authority to run the affairs of the church. The autonomy and independence of the local church is emphasized. In that sense, the governing power rests exclusively with the members of the congregation. This means, the local church can either hire or fire their pastor.</li>
<li><em>The Papal System</em>: As the name suggests, this form of church governance in which the supreme authority is vested in the Pope. From him, the church is governed by cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and priests. The local church or individual member has no say in church administration.</li>
<li><em>The Representative System</em>: this form of church governance recognizes that authority in the church rests in the church membership, with executive responsibility delegated to representative bodies and officers for governing of the church.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;While each of these four systems has some strengths and weaknesses, the Seventh-day Adventist Church practices the fourth one (the Representative).</p>
<p><strong>(i) Discuss:</strong><strong> Strengths and Weaknesses of church governance Systems presented above. </strong></p>
<p><strong>- </strong>The First three forms are not balanced in terms of power practice. Whereas, the Episcopal and the Papal exhibits too much authority as resident upon the leaders of the church. In such forms, leaders operate above board for the rest of their lives regardless of a person&rsquo;s spiritual standing. Church members have no say at all, they are just followers.</p>
<p>- The Congregational leaves too much authority in the hands of the local congregation. While involving church members is good to some extent, it becomes futile if they assume too much power to hire and fire their own pastor. In such scenarios, Pastors lose ministerial dignity for fear of losing their jobs from members, and they also compromise the essence of the gospel message, ministerial integrity, and eventually, they lose the sense of mission.</p>
<p><strong>(</strong><strong>ii) Discuss:</strong><strong> Why do the Seventh-Day Adventist Church prefers the Representative System?</strong></p>
<p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church exists to make disciples of Jesus Christ as mandated in Matthew 28:18-20 and further clarified in Revelation 14:6-12. Toward fulfilment of such mission mandate, the church believes in biblical principles of church governance as clarified in Spirit of Prophecy, and amplified in its church policies. For them, the Representative form of church governance, is somehow balanced in terms of power management. While church members are represented in church governance, they wield overall authority to appoint their representatives and church leaders. At the same time, church leaders are temporarily appointed. Ideally, the representative system leaves no room for anyone or any level of authority to exercise absolute power as if one owns it.</p>
<p>With the Representative form of Church governance, the SDA church is structured in four constituent levels that seek to coordinate initiatives towards mission fulfilment: (a) the local Church; (b) the Conference; (c) the Union Conference; and (d) the General Conference. The Divisions, are extensions of the General Conference that coordinate work in various regions of the work.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of Church Policies</strong></p>
<p>Church policies refers to structured instruments that are used to govern the church from the local congregation to the General Conference. Some major uses of Church Policies include: promotion of order, unity of purpose and practices, and it addresses matters of self-understanding within the world-wide movement. This implies, any attempt by any particular Church, or Conference, or Union, or Division, to set their own regulations of Church practice, or interpret the current Church Policy to suit their own preference of practice, will militate against self-identity of the Church and its mission at large.</p>
<p>Church policies reinforce all our unifying factors such as: shared beliefs and common mission &ldquo;to call all people to become disciples of Jesus Christ, to proclaim the everlasting gospel embraced by the three angels&rsquo; messages, and to prepare the world for Christ&rsquo;s soon return.&rdquo; In other words, the church policies are tools to enable members to become ever more effective in fulfilling our prophetic mission and to become ever more united in &ldquo;the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor 13:14).</p>
<p>Therefore, by upholding the provisions of the Church policy, it reflects the church&rsquo;s desire to foster unity in beliefs, practice, and most of all, uplifting Jesus Christ before the world as Christ appealed for in His prayer (John 17:21-23).</p>
<p><strong>Instruments of Church Governance</strong></p>
<p>The Seventh-day Adventist church utilizes about three key instruments for its governance: the Church Manual, Constitution, and the General Conference Policy. <em>The Church Manual</em> is used as a governing instrument for running local churches worldwide. It spells out operational procedures concerning the function of each local church. While each conference utilizes <em>the</em><em> Constitution</em> for its operations, it also employs <em>the General Conference Working Policy</em> which provides guidelines of operation according to the Division responsible.</p>
<p>The same also applies to the Union Conferences and Divisions: they use local <em>Constitutions</em> as well as <em>the General Conference Working Policy</em>. Both instruments are regular aspects that cannot be altered to suit local preferences. These aspects include issues of fundamental doctrines, and others that defines who we are and our reason of existence. Any need to adjust them, is referred to the GC in Session.</p>
<p>The <em>General Conference Working Policy </em>mandates all denominational organizations and institutions to &ldquo;recognize the authority of the General Conference Session as the highest authority of the Seventh-day Adventist Church under God&rdquo; (B 10 22). This overarching authority of the GC Session was upheld by E. G White; indeed, the just-quoted provision in <em>Working Policy </em>derives from her statements. However, there has been some confusion about what she wrote concerning authority in the Adventist Church, so a brief analysis follows.</p>
<p>Decisions taken at the world Church level are binding on all levels of organizational structure. If there are apparent exceptions, then they are typically in areas where policy is silent or where the world Church devolved powers to lower levels (but the delegation of authority itself points to the overarching authority of the world Church). When it comes to the interrelationship of different levels of organizational structure, the work of general departments, regulating the credentialing and licensing of church workers, the employment of International Service Employees, and broad financial policies, the GC Executive Committee generally takes decisions, but the GC Session is supreme authority in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. This is mandated by the GC Constitution, Bylaws, and <em>Working Policy</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity, Unity, and Church Authority</strong></p>
<p>While the church emphasizes and promotes unity in beliefs and practice, it is fully aware of ethnic and cultural diversity of its members. Whereas some <em>minor differences</em> in church practice might be tolerated, doctrinal unity must not be compromised under the guise of diversity. There must be some clear guidelines that regulate the extent of tolerable <em>differences</em>among believers.</p>
<p>More often, Satan takes diversity as an advantage towards dividing the church of God. In First Corinthians, unity of believers was largely threatened by <em>diverse perspectives</em> on: (1) what constitutes true wisdom; (2) how to deal with lawsuits; (3) attitudes on spiritual giftedness; (4) adultery and fornication issues; (5) attitude on idolatry matters; (6) ethnic issues [Jews-Gentiles relationships]; (7) the true essence of Lord&rsquo;s supper; (8) state of the dead; and so on. The following sub-section highlights some basic principles that may help the church in handling unity in diversity.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION FOR DISCUSSION: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em> Diversity can be a blessing or hindrance towards mission fulfilment? </em></strong><strong>Discuss.</strong></li>
<li><strong><em> The administrative Procedure followed in (Acts 15) regarding solving church issues and determine its Contemporary relevance for the church today.</em></strong><strong>Discuss?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s usage of the body metaphor with reference to the church (Ephesians 4:12), clearly indicates that unity in diversity is one of the chief characteristics of God&rsquo;s church. Such diversity works well when church members complement each other, and are characterized by interdependence in function rather than independence. In every healthy church, decision-making processes take place at the local and regional levels as much as possible. Major decisions are taken at the highest level (The General Conference in Session) by representative bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Handling the Temptation of Individual Decision-making.</strong></p>
<p>Although the Bible has clear guidelines and sound principles that can help the church to unite for a common cause, the temptation of waywardness and arrogance towards unilateral tendencies in church practice are always inevitable within God&rsquo;s church. Since such practices threaten the identity of the church and its focus on mission, the church (depending on the organizational level of the constituency concerned) cannot afford to remain silent. As such, there are clear guidelines of necessary steps that can be taken to resolve such cases.</p>
<p>Each organizational unit such as local church, mission/conference, or union, has certain &ldquo;elements of organizational authority and responsibility&rdquo; delegated to it. The extent of such delegated authority differ according to level of denominational organization. Each local church falls within a constituency of a Conference. Several Conferences constitute a Union Conference which in turn falls under the General Conference. Each level of church organization exercise authority through selected delegates that represent their unit in the decision-making process of higher levels of structure.</p>
<p>Besides the formally mandated processes (like Constituent Meetings, Annual or Mid-year Councils), there should be frequent consultation between officers of different levels as strongly encouraged in General Conference <em>Working Policy</em> (B 40 20; 40 25; 45 05). The &ldquo;representative character of church organization&rdquo; means that every unit is dependent to some extent on the realm of authority exercised by other levels of organization&rdquo; and that its identity cannot be fully defined or viewed in isolation from its relationships with other levels of denominational organization. Such frequent consultation is also significant between each local church leadership and the Pastor responsible.</p>
<p>In sum, the decision-making process at each level involves input from other levels. Unlike traditional hierarchical denominations, authority derives from the lowest level of structure (the local church) and flows upward through constituency-based units to the highest level, the General Conference. In view of such flow of authority, <strong>the GC executive has full authority, within mutually agreed and prescribed limits, over all the elements of the world Church. as part of its exercise of authority, and not vice-versa.</strong> Inherent in this system of representative, consultative, consensus-based decision-making, is that organizational units and church-member representatives have input into the decisions of organizations at higher levels of structure.</p>
<p><strong><u>Discuss the Significance of the bold reference highlighted in the above paragraph</u></strong><strong>. </strong></p>
<p>The GC <em>Working Policy </em>indicates that &ldquo;No mission, conference, or union has a right to take unilateral decisions on important matters, or to depart from decisions taken by units at a higher level of structure with wider authority. While the local church, the conference/mission, and the union have their own constituency, their status &ldquo;is not self-generated, autonomous, or perpetual. Instead, it is granted to a constituency as a trust . . . by an executive committee or a constituency session at higher levels of denominational organization, only &ldquo;by vote of the appropriate constituency or actions of properly authorized executive committees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards redeeming the wayward entities, each level of delegated church authority has an obligation to ensure that there is unity of purpose among the various units under it. For that reason, whenever disciplinary measures should be taken, essential steps will be taken accordingly so to reclaim the wayward units, and also to caution the rest of other entities?</p>
<p><strong>E.G. White</strong><strong>&rsquo;</strong><strong>s Counsel on Decision-Making and Diversity</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>G. White declares- &ldquo;unity in diversity is needed in the different branches of God&rsquo;s great work. This is God&rsquo;s plan, the principle which runs through the entire universe. In God&rsquo;s wise arrangement there is diversity . . . yet He has so related each part to others, that all work in harmony to carry out His great plan of salvation.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>She further asserts that &ldquo;The word of God does not give license for one man to set up his judgment in opposition to the judgment of the church, neither is he allowed to urge his opinions against the opinions of the church. If there were no church discipline and government, the church would go to fragments; it could not hold together as a body. There have ever been individuals of independent minds who have claimed that they were right, that God had especially taught, impressed, and led them. Each has a theory of his own, views peculiar to himself, and each claims that his views are in accordance with the word of God. Each one has a different theory and faith, yet each claims special light from God. These draw away from the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such testimonies leaves no room to elevate own personal views above the collective views, everyone should seek to persuade the rest of the body of believers, and be willing to submit to the authority of the body. This observation is still in harmony with what the same E. G. White also counselled; &ldquo;I have been shown that no man&rsquo;s judgment should be surrendered to the judgment of any one man. But when the judgment of the General Conference, which is the highest authority that God has upon the earth, is exercised, private independence and private judgment must not be maintained, but be surrendered. Your error was in persistently maintaining your private judgment of your duty against the voice of the highest authority the Lord has upon the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the highest authority is not entrusted to one man. White cautions against such practice by arguing, &ldquo;one man&rsquo;s mind, one man&rsquo;s judgment, is not sufficient to be trusted.&rdquo; Instead, significant decisions should be made after prior consultation with other levels of church structure and should be in harmony with decisions already taken by the wider body of believers. This approach helps to guard against distraction and division, promoting unity in church life and an emphasis on mission.</p>
<p>In all the testimonies referred above regarding the authority of the General Conference, White cautions that great care should be taken as to give due consideration to contexts of her testimonies.</p>
<p><strong>Summary and Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In this lesson, several issues regarding church governance and policy are ironed out. God is the author of church governance and policy. Church governance and policy has more to do with worshipping God (the Creator) and serving humanity in preparation of eternity to come. Proper understanding and practice of church governance enhance mission fulfilment. God desires every creature (animate and inanimate), to comply with His governance system. Satan rebelled against such divine mandate and fell from heaven. On the other hand, Satan works hard to influence people to rebel against God&rsquo;s governance and policies. Such scenario clearly indicates that church governance occupies the heart of the great cosmic conflict between good and evil.</p>
<p>There are various forms of church governance. The Seventh-day Adventists prefer the Representative system for its basis in both the Old and the New Testament. Such form of governance promotes unity among believers by ensuring that no one wields total authority to exercise absolute power as if one owns it. With the Representative form of Church governance, there are four constituent levels within the SDA Church: (a) the local Church; (b) the Conference; (c) the Union Conference; and (d) the General Conference. The Divisions, are extensions of the General Conference that coordinate work in various regions of world.</p>
<p>Apart from such strengths, the unity of believers is heavily threatened by rebellioustendencies shown by non-compliance to church policies. Regardless which organizational level manifests such rebellious spirit, there are potential implications that divide the church weaken it from its mission endeavours. This understanding implies that the church should not sacrifice its representative principle of governance, for in doing so, the whole ecclesiastical polity, mission, self-identity, and unity, would be in danger of breaking down. Union Conferences should cooperate with the General Conference&rsquo;s guidance; likewise, local Conferences should cooperate with their Union Conferences. Local churches should also do likewise to their Conferences or Missions.</p>
<p>For the sake of unity and focus on mission fulfilment, the church should seek to maintain and reinforce its principles of interconnectedness and interdependence by consulting the Bible, SOP, and upholding established Church policies. More prayers are needed on behalf of all levels of our organizational structures so that the evil one may not use some of the organizational entities to tear down what Christ alone has purchased by His own blood. More so, dependence on God&rsquo;s Word must be our motto as the Prophet Isaiah echoed in (8:20) &ldquo;To the Law and to the testimony, if they speak not according to this Word, it is because they do not have light in them.&rdquo;</p>
