<p><strong>Lesson Delivery</strong></p>
<p>I encourage the use of discussion mode more than the lecture approach. My experience is that sermonizing tends to leave a lot of participants&rsquo; questions unaddressed. However, facilitators should still be able to give some lesson overview as well as closing remarks. And in order to stimulate discussion, I have provided some questions at the beginning Part One and Part Two. However, facilitators are free to replace these questions with what they may deem relevant to their audiences. Participants should also be allowed to ask questions during the course of discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Part One: </strong><strong>Human Pairing and Biblical Definition of Marriage</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Discussion Questions</u></p>
<p>I advise against use of hate speech as you answer the following questions. While your views may differ from others, you should still respect and not condemn them.</p>
<ol>
<li>What similarities and/or differences exist between human beings and other species in selecting their mates?</li>
<li>What are some of the trending paring practices in the world today?</li>
<li>How does your culture/society define marriage? How similar or different is that definition from the biblical one?</li>
</ol>
<p>Before we discuss marital faithfulness, dating and courtship, effective communication and inheritance, I want us to briefly reflect on how human beings select their mates and then zero in on the biblical definition of marriage. We need this as the basis for reflecting on the principles that make marriages work to God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p><strong>Human Pairing </strong></p>
<p>Non-human species tend to use instincts or species typical behavior to choose their mates. However, human beings differ greatly from mere animals. They use free will choice, all things being equal, which is why I think that marriage is one of those practices on earth that separate us from the rest of creation. Think of dating, courtship, engagement, bridal price (lobola) and weddings. Not even angels enjoy such a privilege. However, differences do exist in how civilizations, countries, cultures, religions and other preferences approach human sexuality. And some of the factors that influence human pairing include, but are not limited to respective concepts of love, human rights, purpose, gender, age, types of marriage, and etc. Time, unfortunately, forbids a detailed discussion on these aspects in this particular session and in view of this limitation, here is the biblical position on human pairing especially with respect to marriage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marriage is a God given right. It is a human right (1 Corinthians 7: 1-2). However not everyone is expected to marry. Others may remain single by choice or by some circumstances beyond their control (1 Corinthians 7: 6-9).</li>
<li>Marriage serves as the only provision set apart by the Creator God for sexual pleasure and procreation (1 Corinthians 7: 1-2; Malachi 2: 13-15).</li>
<li>Marriage should take place between opposite sexes - male and female (Matthew 19:4-5; Romans 7: 26-27).</li>
<li>Marriage is meant for adults. All marriages of God&rsquo;s people across the Bible involve adult men and women.</li>
<li>Marriage is an exclusive union of two parties (monogamy) &ndash; a husband and wife (Genesis 2: 24; Matthew 19: 4-5; 1 Timothy 3: 2).</li>
<li>Marriage is a legal institution (Romans 7: 2). The Bible does support country laws that reinforce God&rsquo;s will (Romans 13: 1-5).</li>
<li>Marriage is spiritually and morally holy (Malachi 2: 13-15; Ephesians 5: 22-25; Hebrews 13: 4).</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us look at the biblical definition of marriage including the importance of defining it.</p>
<p><strong>Biblical Definition of Marriage </strong></p>
<p>Genesis 2:24 NKJV reads, &ldquo;<em>Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and&nbsp;be&nbsp;joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above text, which Jesus also quotes in Matthew 19:4-5, provides a broad statement that defines marriage. I see that two separate individuals (lives) come together to form one entity. Each part moves away from its point of origin (father and mother or parents) and join together to create a completely new shared self. No wonder Ephesians 5: 28-29 says, &ldquo;<strong><em><sup>28&nbsp;</sup></em></strong><em>So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself.&nbsp;<strong><sup>29&nbsp;</sup></strong>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord&nbsp;does&nbsp;the church.&rdquo;</em> It is as it were, two separate human beings become one human being in marriage. When a husband is looking at his wife it is as if he is seeing himself and the opposite is true. What a mystery!</p>
<p>To help you and I understand this mystery of one flesh, the writer of the book of Genesis uses creation (<a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/one-flesh-marriage.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/one-flesh-marriage.html</a>). See Genesis 2: 21-23 below,</p>
<p><strong><em><sup>21&nbsp;</sup></em></strong><em>And the&nbsp;</em><em>Lord</em><em>&nbsp;God caused a&nbsp;deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place.&nbsp;<strong><sup>22&nbsp;</sup></strong>Then the rib which the&nbsp;</em><em>Lord</em><em>&nbsp;God had taken from man He&nbsp;made into a woman,&nbsp;and He&nbsp;brought her to the man.</em><em><strong><sup>23&nbsp;</sup></strong>And Adam said: &ldquo;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;now&nbsp;bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was&nbsp;taken out of&nbsp;man.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In a real physical sense Adam and Eve shared the same flesh. No wonder Adam saw Eve and declared that she was a part of him. It can, therefore, be argued that Adam was physically in Eve and Eve was in Adam in like manner. Hence their one flesh. Someone once said that the &lsquo;one&rsquo; that appears in Genesis 2: 24 implies a number that you cannot add to nor divide (<a href="https://theexplanation.com/one-flesh-ultimately-inseparable-together-forever/">https://theexplanation.com/one-flesh-ultimately-inseparable-together-forever/</a>). So marriage turned Adam and Eve&rsquo;s lives into one institution (one flesh). They retained their individual selves (personality), but lived together as one institution. How best, then, should this concept of one flesh (institution) be understood in practical terms?</p>
<p>At least five factors interplay to portray the one flesh institution which are, <strong>the permanency of marriage </strong>(Matthew 19: 6; Malachi 2: 16; Romans 7: 2-3). Marriage should remain in force for as long as both parties shall live and should only be terminated under God&rsquo;s terms (Romans 7: 2; Matthew 19: 8); <strong>the marriage covenant</strong> (Malachi 2: 13-14; Matthew 19: 6 - &lsquo;You are mine and I am yours. Hence, no one (parents, children, relatives, friends or any other person) should come in between us; <strong>the exclusivity of sexual intimacy and procreation </strong>(1 Corinthians 7: 1-5, 8-9; Exodus 20: 14; Malachi 2: 13-15). Sex or love making and producing children should only take place within marriage. Any other form of sexual pleasure that may include, but are not limited to masturbation, pornography, and extramarital affairs are prohibited in a biblically sanctioned marriage; <strong>the holiness of marriage</strong> - Marriage belongs to God through creation (Matthew 19: 4-6). He set it apart to symbolise the relationship between Christ and His church (Ephesians 5: 22-32) and; <strong>the oneness of God</strong> - The marriage institution symbolizes God&rsquo;s oneness (the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit &ndash; Matthew 28: 19; John 17: 21; Deuteronomy 6:4). You cannot divide the Holy Trinity neither can you add to it. The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are One God not three Gods even though each one of them is God in his own right. Similarly, even though a husband and a wife are two separate human beings, but God regards them as one indivisible whole [institution] which you cannot add to (Matthew 19: 4-6).</p>
<p>The next very important question is, &lsquo;why is it important to define marriage?&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Defining Marriage </strong></p>
<p>There could be no better reason to define marriage than what Micah states. Here is what he says in Micah 6: 8NKJV<em>, &ldquo;He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you&hellip;&rdquo; </em></p>
<p>God created marriage and gave it to humanity as a gift. It is His institution not ours. That makes us, married or not, stewards of this sacred trust. Stewards, like I am saying, includes the couple, children, parents and relatives from both sides, friends, church and community. Therefore, it is very important to understand what God calls marriage and the purpose it serves including the principles that make it good lest we run the risk of distorting His original plan for human pairing.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Part One Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Marriage is as old as creation. It is not a human invention. It is God&rsquo;s idea for pairing human beings into sexual relationships. His definition of marriage is heterosexual (male and female) and monogamous. The parties that desire to marry should be adult enough to function as an independent institution that preserves the oneness of matrimony. They are accountable to God first and then to the laws of the land (to the extent allowed by God&rsquo;s revealed will). Only married couples have the privilege to sexual pleasure and procreation according to the Creator. The idea of covenant also makes the marriage relationship permanently bidding for as long as both parties shall live. Of special note, the Bible views only God as having the right to define what Christian marriage entails including the principles that make it good. Anything outside of His revealed will distorts His original plan for human sexual relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Part Two: Developing and Managing Marital Relationships</strong></p>
<p>Discussion Questions</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you understand the concept marital faithfulness? What is involved?</li>
<li>What role do dating and courtship play in human sexuality? What are some of the biblical principles to guide such relationships?</li>
<li>How important is communication among God&rsquo;s people? What does the Bible say?</li>
<li>Is it right for a widow to be inherited into marriage by a brother or close relative of her deceased husband? What does your culture and the Bible say?</li>
</ol>
<p>I am using Part Two of our lesson to apply some of the principles of marriage I mentioned in Part One. I have added to that list so that the items for discussion in this session give a clear picture of what we are talking about. That said, Part Two addresses marital faithfulness, dating and courtship, effective communication, and inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>Marital Faithfulness</strong></p>
<p>Faithfulness constitutes one of the principles and practices that bring goodness into human sexuality and into marriage in particular from the biblical standpoint. No wonder God included the commandment that prohibits unfaithfulness in sexual conduct for both the married and the unmarried (Exodus 20:14; 1 Corinthians 7: 1, 2, 8 and 9). However, God&rsquo;s view of faithfulness in marriage goes beyond sexual purity. It also includes the whole law (Ten Commandments) and its derivatives. Let me show you how this whole law business works.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ten Commandments are one law. If you break one of them, you will have broken the whole law (James 2: 10).</li>
<li>The law has two parts. The first four address our relationship and obligation to God. The last six spell out our relationship and duty to our fellow human beings.</li>
<li>In view of marriage, the last six commandments obligate married people:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>To respect and submit to each other in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 5: 21).</li>
<li>To live and let live. For example, avoid risky behaviour that spreads communicable diseases. You also need to reduce any behaviour that leads to psychological and emotional injury (Ephesians 4: 29-32).</li>
<li>To avoid ALL forms of adultery and fornication (extramarital affairs and all sexual misconduct like pornography, sexually suggestive joking or messages on social media or otherwise with people other than spouse).</li>
<li>To allow self and spouse including other people to enjoy their God given human rights (e.g. right to personal development, survival needs, intellectual property and etc.).</li>
<li>To be open and truthful to each other.</li>
<li>To be unconditionally content with the spouse one has.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The first four commandments (our relationship with God) set the stage for the last six commandments to be fulfilled. If you don&rsquo;t fear God, it will be difficult to treat fellow human beings with real love and dignity.</li>
<li>The spirit of the law is love (Romans 13: 8-10; 1 Corinthians 13: 4-8).</li>
<li>God fearing spouses keep God&rsquo;s commandments because of their faith in Jesus Christ (Revelation 14: 12).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, faith and faithfulness to Jesus empowers spouses to fulfil their marital vows throughout the seasons of their marriage (Galatians 2: 20; 5: 22-26; Romans 8: 35-39). Each spouse, in the spirit of Christ, becomes faithful to consider the needs of the other spouse as more important than their own and does everything it takes to facilitate their fulfilment.</p>
<p>Therefore, marital faithfulness embodies sexual purity and all the other aspects of managing married life.</p>
<p><strong>Dating and Courtship </strong></p>
<p>The words dating and courtship do not appear in the Bible, at least as much as I can remember. This does not mean, however, that the people of Bible times did not date and court. Whatever the case may be, dating and courting are culture based, not-with-standing the fact that a lot has changed in how people date or court over the years (like online dating). And let me be quick to also admit that the Bible is not prescriptive on how to date or court either. So it is not possible to claim that the biblical way of dating or courting is this or that. However, the Bible does have basic principles that should guide dating and courtship. How to implement these principles depends on personal preferences, culture, religion and other considerations.</p>
<p>Before I share the biblical principles, let me define how I understand what dating and courtship are and what purposes they save.</p>
<p>Dating are various forms of interpersonal encounters that enable respective parties to get to know each other closely with the view of seeing if they can develop some form of friendships especially intimate ones. On the other hand, courtship is a higher level of dating. This is when the parties go stead and their eyes seem to be focused on the goal and decision for marriage. Please consult relevant literature for detailed explanation on these terms.</p>
<p>What then are some of the biblical principles that should guide both dating and courtship? No problem. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be the light of the world. You are the sermon (Matthew 5: 16).</li>
<li>Avoid canal friendships (1 Corinthians 15: 33). I mean friends whose goal of dating and courtship is sex before marriage. There are people who mistaken sex for love and so each time they are dating or courting, sex becomes part of the equation resulting into multiple sex partners since it is common to date more than one person in a life time. You are different. Hence you need to say, &lsquo;No&rsquo;, to sex and wait for the right time. Real love waits.</li>
<li>Have a wide base of principles and values that inform your life choices (Exodus 20: 3-17; Romans 13: 8-10; Genesis 39: 7-9; Daniel 1: 8).</li>
<li>Try to date and court people who you hold many things in common (2 Corinthians 6: 14-18). Even among people of the same faith, the more similarities between the two of you, the better will be the quality of your relationship other things being equal.</li>
<li>Avoid treating dating and courtship as if they are marriages. You are free to break them if that will be in your best interest and more especially of the other party (2 Corinthians 7: 36-38; Philippians 2: 3-4). It is better to break dating and courtship relationships than to break a marriage (Malachi 2: 16).</li>
<li>Seek counsel from some role models (Proverbs 15: 22).</li>
<li>Commit your plans to God whether it be dating or courtship (Proverbs 16: 2-3; 1 Samuel 16: 6-7). Beauty is not only physical. Character and belief systems deserve serious consideration.</li>
<li>Be born again (John 3:3-6; Romans 6: 1-5; Galatians 5:22-26). Those who walk in the Spirit exercise moral restraints and are inclined to make the right choices and decisions.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t allow guilt to kill you. Repent in areas where you are not behaving well in your dating or courtship experiences. God will forgive you (Ezekiel 33: 10-11; 1 John 1: 9).</li>
<li>Avoid identity crisis. You are still complete even if you date, court, marry or not (1 Corinthians 7: 8-9).</li>
<li>You should not date or court married people (Genesis 39: 7-9; 1 Corinthians 7: 1-2).</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, dating and courtship are temporary relationships that may lead to marriage. They are meant to learn and to know each other better and closely. &lsquo;Take time to know her/him.&rsquo; Since they are not at the same level and commitment as marriage, their parties are not biblically entitled to sexual pleasure and procreation. The Bible does not, however, prescribe how to date or court, but simply supplies broad based principles necessary for developing and managing such relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Effective Communication </strong></p>
<p>Good communication communicates. In other words, it enables two or more people to exchange messages without distortions in meaning. No wonder communication is one of the major themes in the Bible. And if husbands and wives and significant others value fulfilling relationships, then effective communication becomes a must. Fortunately, the Bible also has principles of good communication which include, but are not limited to, active listening, discernment, understanding, and edification.</p>
<p><u>Active listening</u></p>
<p>Proverbs 18:13 CJB says, in what appears to be one of the strongest rebukes in the Bible, &ldquo;<em>To answer someone before hearing him (her-inserted) out is both stupid and embarrassing</em>.&rdquo; This text demonstrates that effective communication requires that care be exercised in listening to what the other person is trying to put across. If active listening is not involved, people simply end up speaking at each other and not with each other resulting in communication breakdown. Here are some of the tips that may help boost active listening:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restate in your own words what the other person is trying to put across. &lsquo;Do I hear to be saying&hellip;?&rsquo;</li>
<li>Ask questions like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not quite getting what you are saying, my love. What exactly do you mean?&rsquo;</li>
<li>Stop whatever you are doing and for a moment pay attention to what the other person is saying. Show interest.</li>
<li>Check for congruency between verbal and body language. You may probe should there be no match between verbal and nonverbal communication. &lsquo;I hear you are happy to receive this birthday gift, but you look disheartened. Is there a problem, my dear?&rsquo;</li>
<li>Keep eye conduct with the other person to show you are paying attention to what they are saying as much as it permissible in your culture.</li>
<li>Please read more on active listening and improve the quality of your communication skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Discernment</u></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Discernment is the ability to see things for what they really are and not for what you want them to be (</em><a href="https://biblereasons.com/discernment/)"><em>https://biblereasons.com/discernment</em>/)</a>.&rdquo; It is an essential tool in communication as well. For human communication can be straightforward and clear as a full moon in cloudless skies. However, it can also be very complex. The message the other person may want to put across may not always be that obvious due to a number of factors such as emotions, deception, assertiveness issues, culture, religion, upbringing and so on. The hearer may have to go to pains to distinguish the similarity or difference between what is being said and what it really means. Words are not the message, but they carry the message. So discernment goes further. It sees beyond the ordinary. The classic example of discernment in the Bible happened when Jehoshaphat listened to the prophet Ahab had called to share the prospects of the war before them. After careful listening, Jehoshaphat turned to Ahab and said, &ldquo;<em>Is there not still another prophet of the LORD here, we may inquire of him?</em> (1 Kings 22: 7 NKJV)&rdquo; He had discerned that Ahab&rsquo;s prophet lied. That prophet only told the two kings what he thought they wanted to hear.</p>
<p>The big question, however, is - how do we acquire discernment? Simple. &ldquo;Discernment is more than just what you and I hear or see. It is given to us by the Holy Spirit (https://biblereasons.com/discernment/). This brings in another dimension to human communication. God, the Revealer of mysteries, is often the missing link in our communication. If we invite Him in, He will enable us to see or hear and understand each other. For this reason I strongly recommend that you and me should fellowship with Him in prayer (Acts 1: 23-25) and Bible study (Hebrews 4:12) as part of transforming our communication skills.</p>
<p><u>Understanding</u></p>
<p>Victorino Q. Abrugar (https://inspiringtips.com/knowledge-wisdom-understanding-and-insight-what-are-the-differences/#On_the_meaning_and_definition) once said, &ldquo;<em>Understanding is the ability to understand one&rsquo;s knowledge and choices. It is the realization of your decision. It is knowledge and wisdom put into action. If knowledge is power, and wisdom is your choice to use that power, understanding is the execution of your choice to use that power. We develop understanding when we practice what we preach</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abrugar&rsquo;s definition of understanding helps us understand how understanding applies in communication.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, you get to know what the other person is communicating (the message). This constitutes knowledge.</li>
<li>Secondly, you make choices on how to use that knowledge as feedback to the sender of the message. Abrugar calls this stage wisdom.</li>
<li>Lastly, you apply your choices (wisdom) into the situation or context before you. Only application manifests understanding since understanding is an action and not just a body of knowledge or choices. So knowing that your spouse is not comfortable with you coming home late at night and knowing that the wise thing to do is to adjust your times to accommodate her concerns does not tell us that you understand her until you change your behaviour. Understanding, therefore, is doing the right thing given the situation. Ironically, some people who know do not understand because of lack of congruency between knowledge and the doing (actions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Edification</p>
<p>According to the Bible, edification (as in relationship building) rises above all conceivable goals in communication. Ephesians 4: 29-31 GNT says, &ldquo;<em>Do not use harmful words, but only helpful words, the kind that build up and provide what is needed, so that what you say will do good to those who hear you</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul seems to have been a communication guru of his day. Listen again to what he says in Colossians 4:6 NIV, &ldquo;<em>Let your conversation be always full of grace,&nbsp;seasoned with salt,&nbsp;so that you may know how to answer everyone</em>.<sup>&rdquo;</sup></p>
<p>Let me go back to the issue of stewardship. We are our brothers and sisters&rsquo; keepers (Genesis 4: 9) and God wants us to guard their mental health jealously because careless words have a damaging effect. Jane Epland could not have put it any better. Take a listen, &ldquo;<em>It is not necessarily physical blows that are the most harmful. Words can reduce a person&rsquo;s self-esteem to next to nothing in an instant&hellip; The damage can last for years&hellip; We&rsquo;re talking about harsh, judgmental words that you and I can easily let slip out without thinking</em> (<a href="https://activechristianity.org/do-you-realize-how-hurtful-your-words-can-be-2">https://activechristianity.org/do-you-realize-how-hurtful-your-words-can-be-2</a>)&rdquo;</p>
<p>So God children do not just speak in order to be heard. They speak in order to build.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance</strong></p>
<p>Inheritance finds itself as one of the major recorded themes in the ancient Hebrew culture especially in the Old Testament. Land topped the list of what comprised inheritance especially considering that the call of Abraham (Genesis 12: 1-7) and the outcome of the Great Exodus (Exodus 3: 7-8) focused mainly on God giving the land of Canaan as an inheritance to the twelve tribes of Israel to divide among their households. So the Hebrew people guarded jealously this priced possession. Each household needed to ensure that the next generations would not lose their inheritance to nongeneological descendants (1 Kings 21: 3).</p>
<p>In order for property to remain in the hands of a family and its posterity, you would need to produce your own offspring, especially sons who would be heirs to their father&rsquo;s estate. However, during Moses&rsquo; time even the girl child would claim their father&rsquo;s inheritance should they have no brothers (Numbers 27: 1-11). Apart from land, children, especially sons, would be needed in order to preserve their father&rsquo;s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately some men died before they had children of their own. This opened doors for their surviving widows to remarry. Remarrying outside the deceased husband&rsquo;s clan meant two things. The family inheritance risked falling in the hands of strangers and the deceased&rsquo; name would perpetually die. The Hebrews disliked that scenario and Deuteronomy 25: 5 provided an answer to mitigate this challenge. One of the brothers or a close relative of the deceased husband would be forced to take the widow into marriage to produce children on his behalf (sperm donor). This type of relationship was known as levirate marriage and refusing to enter into it invited the displeasure of the community. This custom predates Moses (Genesis 38:6).</p>
<p>And please note that Deuteronomy 25: 5 only applied to a situation where a man died before he had had children. Otherwise Leviticus 18: 8 forbade a man to marry his brother&rsquo;s wife or close relative. Some writings from Paul also show signs that The New Testament church (Christianity) had shifted or started shifting from the levirate marriages to something that gave widows freedom of choice. In 1 Corinthians 7: 39 NIV he says, &ldquo;<em>A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord</em>.&rdquo; Even the Greco-Roman law disapproved levirate marriages which it outlawed by the 4<sup>th</sup> century AD. It regarded such marriages as incestuous (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-religion/article/biblical-law-in-grecoroman-attire-the-case-of-levirate-marriage-in-late-antique-christian-legal-traditions/EF7910BFB349F26D712335B95BF2ED5A">BIBLICAL LAW IN GRECO-ROMAN ATTIRE: THE CASE OF LEVIRATE MARRIAGE IN LATE ANTIQUE CHRISTIAN LEGAL TRADITIONS | Journal of Law and Religion | Cambridge Core</a>).</p>
<p>Close scrutiny suggests that the Bible (Old and New Testaments) actually discourages marrying close relatives. However, Acts 17: 30 says that in the days of ignorance God winked, but now expects all people to come to repentance. We need to go by the counsel from Paul which declares that after death, the remaining spouse is freed from the law of marriage and hence free to marry anyone of choice. No one should force you to marry a close relative even if your culture expects you to. God is above all our cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Part Two Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>God owns the marriage institution and, as the Owner, He has a say in what goes on in the relationships leading to marriage, in marriage and thereafter. He has provided principles that should guide human behavior across all marital aspects such as faithfulness, dating, courtship, communication and inheritance. No one is left to guess.</p>
