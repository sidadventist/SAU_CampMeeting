<p><strong>Key Text:- </strong>"Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits" (Proverbs 18:21)</p>
<p><strong>Quote from Ellen G. White </strong></p>
<p>"The tongue is a little member, but the words it frames have great power&hellip; With the tongue, we comfort and bless, soothing the bruised, wounded soul. With the tongue, we may make known the wonders of the grace of God. With the tongue also we may utter perverse things, speaking words that sting like an adder" <em>(The Gift of the Speech)</em></p>
<p><strong>Morning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Proverbs 18: 21, we learn that "death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits." This lesson discusses the role the tongue plays in creating life if used correctly and destroying it if abused. The tongue is metaphorically used here to represent the words a person can utter at any given moment and how these words can help enhance or destroy life. The word 'life' is used in the generic sense here to represent anything the human mind perceives as good and worth pursuing, and 'death' as representing anything terrible and not worth pursuing. Both biblical counsel and the Spirit of Prophecy guide the lesson.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>By the end of the lesson, students must be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>sDemonstrate how the power of the tongue can lead to personality development.</li>
<li>Show how the power of the tongue can build or destroy the marriage institution.</li>
<li>Show how the power of the tongue can promote Christian fellowship and spiritual growth.</li>
<li>Identify biblical characters who were victims of the abuse of the power of the tongue, and draw lessons from that.</li>
<li>Practice self-control and discipline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can personality be developed by using or abusing the power of the tongue?</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE TONGUE AND PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The tongue and self-esteem</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Self-esteem</em> relates to how a person values himself or herself concerning what he or she is capable of doing or not doing. There are three types of self-esteem: high, low, and inflated. When a person has <em>high self-esteem,</em> it means that they have confidence in themselves and their capabilities and self-worthiness. The challenges of life do not easily weigh down such a person.</p>
<p>Conversely, when a person has <em>low self-esteem, it means that they have a low opinion of themselves and what they are</em> capable of doing in life. <em>Inflated self-esteem</em> tends to cause people to have a high opinion of themselves and a low opinion towards others. People with inflated self-esteem think that they know better than others. They think their opinion should always carry the day if they are in a family set-up, Church and other public spaces. They have inflated egos.</p>
<p><strong>The question that begs for answers is: Is there a link between the abuse of the power of the tongue or words and self-esteem &ndash; be it high, low or inflated? </strong></p>
<p>Suffice it to say that the tongue or words are among the many causes of high, low, or inflated self-esteem. Other causes include one's thoughts or perceptions, unhappy childhood, bullying at school, illness and experiences at home, school and work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The power of the tongue or words on high, low or inflated self-esteem </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a family or society where children grow up being told that they are exceptional and that God has a purpose for their lives, and that they have the capacity to impact the world positively, such children tend to develop high self-esteem, which, in turn, impacts their cognitive, psychomotor and spiritual development.</p>
<p>However, in a family or society where children are constantly abused emotionally and physically, they tend to develop a low opinion of themselves, and this negatively impacts their performance at school and their opinion about themselves in later life. Such people are prone to suicide as they do not see the purpose of living. The biblical counsel is that any parent, guardian, or anyone who verbally abuses children or any other person shall account for that before God on the day of judgment (Matthew 12:36).</p>
<p>In a family or society where self-exaltation is celebrated more than humility, children raised in such environments tend to have inflated egos leading to inflated self-esteem. Such people tend to exhibit pride later in life, emanating from the fact that they consider themselves more important than anyone. Lucifer developed self-exaltation/pride, resulting in Heaven disowning him and throwing him to the earth (Revelations 12: 7-9). Many people who exhibit pride today are products of a family or society celebrating self-exaltation at humility's expense. Such people are usually rejected by society. The story of the Pharisee and the sinner who went to a temple to pray also illustrates this point (Luke 18: 9-14).</p>
<p><strong>Can the tongue sustain or destroy a marriage?</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE POWER OF THE TONGUE AND THE MARRIAGE INSTITUTION</strong></p>
<p>Marriage, just like the Sabbath, is a powerful institution which has a bearing on salvation history. In Genesis 2: 22-25, God creates Eve and gives her to Adam as his wife, and this episode marks the beginning of the marriage institution. God intended for the man and woman in marriage to stay together peacefully and in harmony forever. The first words by Adam after God had given him Eve as his wife were life-affirming and assuring. He said: "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, for she was taken out of man" (v 23). These words meant that marriage would be the most beautiful thing on earth.</p>
<p>When sin entered the world, everything changed. It meant that marriage would not last forever anymore and that it would no longer be rosy. One of the agents the devil uses to ensure that marriage becomes bitter is the tongue or words. The tongue can sustain or destroy a marriage. A husband or wife's use of the tongue can ensure the sustenance of a marriage or its break up. How couples verbally react to marital situations can affect the marriage's happiness or unhappiness.</p>
<p>Many faithful Christians today suffer from verbal abuse perpetrated by either a husband or a wife resulting in unhappy marriages. Many divorces result from abusing the power of the tongue in a marriage, and despite the pronouncement by God Himself that he detests divorce (Malachi 2:16) and that the only reason when a divorce can be decreed is when they are allegations of sexual immorality (Matthew 19:9). Marcia Mediation Group, an online Website, estimates that 65% of all divorces in the world are a result of communication problems. It shows how powerful the tongue is in contributing to marriage breakdowns worldwide.</p>
<p>In James 1 19-20, a wise counsel is given to man that "&hellip;everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger; for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God." In Proverbs 21:19, a quarrelsome wife is taken to the cleaners. The charge is "better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and nagging wife." Obviously, in the two books cited immediately above, the call is to restrain the tongue and promote peaceful co-existence in marriage.</p>
<p><strong>AFTERNOON</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>How does the tongue contribute to mission or backsliding?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>THE POWER OF THE TONGUE AND CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP</strong></p>
<p>While evangelism is a powerful way of using the tongue to promote God's work or mission, the same tongue can be used to sow seeds of division in the Church. For instance, to the Church in Ephesus, Paul charges that bitterness, wrath, anger and slander should be put away from them, along with malice (Ephesians 4:31). Here, we are more interested in the word slander as it is the one which is closely connected to the abuse of the power of the tongue. <strong>Slander means saying words that are not truthful but calculated to damage another person's reputation. </strong>They are many people in the Church today who have caused fellow Christians to backslide after peddling falsehoods against them. Others have sown divisions among church members through gossip resulting in fellow Christians who worship in the same Church failing to get along with each other. It tends to put God's Church in disrepute.</p>
<p><strong>Does the tongue contribute to the discourse of morality?</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE TONGUE AND MORALITY </strong></p>
<p>The tongue is a powerful weapon in aiding moral aptitudes such as prayer, encouragement, disciplining, supplication and singing hymns of praise. Prayer is a way of reaching out to give him petitions that speak to the character of the person praying. Through faithful prayer, God can respond to the one who is praying by endowing him or her with the virtues of honesty, love, personal integrity and patience.</p>
<p>The tongue can be used to encourage those who have lost hope in life due to punishing poverty, the vestiges of disease and all forms of abuse. The tongue can also be used as a tool for disciplining children, rebuking unbecoming adult behaviour and counselling those in social, economic and spiritual distress.</p>
<p>There is also a need to discipline the tongue when talking or interacting with peers so that it does not cause irreparable moral damage to its victims. The tongue can also be a helpful tool for singing hymns of praise. In the Davidic Psalmody, we see the power of the tongue in praising God through singing. Thus, the whole of Psalms is a Psalmody of David's praises to God.</p>
<p><strong>Which Biblical characters were victims of the abuse of the power of the tongue?</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE TONGUE AND BIBLICAL TESTIMONIES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>THE POWER OF THE TONGUE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF HANNAH </strong>(1 Samuel 1: 2-20)</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1 Samuel 1: 1-20, we learn of Elkanah who had two wives: Hannah and Penninah. We learn that Penninah had children, while Hannah had no children (v.2). We also learn that Elkanah loved Hannah, but because she was barren, Penninah kept mocking her to irritate her (v.5-6). We learn that in her deep anguish, Hannah prayed to God, weeping bitterly, asking God to remember her by giving her a son (v. 10-11). Hannah persisted in prayer, and finally, we learn that she became pregnant and gave birth to a son whom she called Samuel, for she had asked the Lord God for him (v. 20).</p>
<p>They are many lessons we can learn here. Naturally, Hannah should have been discouraged by Penninah's provocations and stopped praying, but the provocations gave her more impetus to pray to God. The lesson here is that sometimes the negative energy we direct towards others through words gives them the strength to pray to God and get what they want.</p>
<p>If Hannah had interpreted Penninah's provocations to mean that her situation was irredeemable, she would have lost focus. Nevertheless, Hannah knew that God was a God of impossibilities and that her prayers would be answered one day. We will only grow spiritually if we focus on what we want to achieve than focusing on distractions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>THE POWER OF THE TONGUE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF JOB (</strong>Job 4:7-8, Job 8: 20, Job 11: 14-15,17)</li>
</ul>
<p>Eliphaz was the first to blame Job for his fate. He says in Job 4:7-8, "Consider now: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed? As I have observed, those who plough evil and those who sow trouble reap it."</p>
<p>These words were quite reckless from someone Job considered a friend. They were like a needle piercing the heart, leaving the recipient, Job, distraught.</p>
<p>Bildad, another of Job's friends, weighed in, saying, "Surely God does not reject one who is blameless or strengthen the hands of evildoers" (Job 8:20). By these words, Bildad was intimating that Job was an evildoer, and that is why he was in that unfortunate situation. These words were unfair to Job because God described him as a blameless man. They are many people in the Church today who specialize in apportioning blame to people who are victims of fate. They rub salt to injury by uttering destructive words to the recipient.</p>
<p>The last of his friends, Zophar, said to Job, "If you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent, then, free of fault, you will lift your face; you will stand firm and without fear" (Job 11: 14-15). Like Eliphaz and Bildad, who came before him, Zophar saw Job's misfortune as caused by sin. How wrong he was. Misfortune befalls everyone, including God's beloved people. If only Zophar had carefully chosen his words, he would have spared Job the burden of unjustifiable blame he was heaping on him. Even today, as Christians are called upon to carefully choose our words before we utter them, lest we invite God's wrath by apportioning blame to God's beloved people.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>In this lesson, we learnt that the tongue is a tiny body organ that can give life or is like a match stick that can burn the whole forest. We focused on three aspects of life: personality development, marriage life and spiritual growth. The lesson also highlighted that life-affirming and discipline are needed when talking or interacting with peers. We gleaned from the Bible to see if they are Biblical characters whose lives were enhanced or destroyed by the tongue. In particular, we focused on the experiences of Hannah and Job.</p>
<p><strong>PRAYER POINT</strong></p>
<p>Class to pray for the tongue so that it can create life rather than destroy it.</p>
