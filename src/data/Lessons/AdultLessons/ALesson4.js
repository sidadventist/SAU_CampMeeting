Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm, and he that earneth wages [to put it] into a bag with holes. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways (Haggai 1:5-7).</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Haggai 1:5-7 speaks about humanity's predicament in today's world where almost everything seemingly makes no sense. For example:-&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People work such a hard reward that hard work does not correspond to the energy and effort invested.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Foodstuffs are seemingly plenty around us, and people sometimes eat, but fulfilment and contentment are challenging.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Clothing and raiment are plenty in the markets, but the world population is naked?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People often get some reasonable income in their different capacities, but it seems the challenge comes with the fruitful utilisation of those resources. It seems the wind blows all away.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHY IS IT SEEMINGLY SO? DISCUSS</strong></li>

<li>Haggai 1:5-7, God answers humanity by reminding us to "Consider our ways." In other words, to introspect how we are doing things!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This lesson seeks to help humanity to consider the strategies, methods, and ways we are using in working, accumulation of wealth/ resources, and our utilisation of the same while we are "Looking for that blessed hope&hellip; (Titus 1:3).</li>

<p><strong>The Stewardship Mantra</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stewardship Ministries, in consultation with church counterparts, develops and implements a well-defined strategy for achieving Total Stewardship in each organisational unit that reflects changes in membership and inflation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stewardship comes in as one of the <strong>FOUR KEY PILLARS </strong>Of our Strategic Plan, which falls under The <strong>SPIRITUAL GROWTH PILLAR</strong><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tithes and offerings are the measures we can use to monitor our faithfulness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>THE GOAL&lt;&gt; </strong>Every local Church to increase the percentage of givers, both tithes and offerings, by 5% annually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE "SPIRITUAL GROWTH" PILLAR</strong></p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To disciple individuals and families into Spirit-filled lives</li>
<li>Increase the practice of stewardship principles concerning time, talents/spiritual gifts, truth/ testimony, terrain/ environment, and treasure (tithes and offerings)</li>
<li>To revive the concept of worldwide mission and sacrifice for the mission as a way of life involving not only pastors but every church member, young and old, in the joy of witnessing for Christ and making disciples</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To increase accession, retention, reclamation, and participation of children, youth, and young adults.</li>
<li>All members and yet-to-be-baptised young people embrace and practice stewardship principles</li>
</ul>
<p>regarding time, spiritual gifts, tithes and offerings</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To help youth and young adults place God first and exemplify a biblical worldview of managing resources.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Help Bible classes teach confidence in the Bible as divine revelation, trust in God, and commitment to His mission.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Anchoring our youth and members in Bible-based Adventist thinking and practice of wealth-creation and utilisation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE 4</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: To create an enabling environment for mission in constantly changing times.</li>
<li>Pastors, church members, and institutions can effectively fulfil their missionary mandate during crises.</li>
<li>All institutions can operate sustainably during crisis periods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHY THE EMPHASIS ON STEWARDSHIP &amp; SELF RELIANCE?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To multiply spiritual, physical, &amp; material resources creatively to maximize participation (TMI) in the divine commission of Jesus to carry the gospel to all the world.</li>
<li>We are enlisting &amp; empowering members in income generation and the multiplication of local resources.</li>
<li>Bringing about greater "ownership" of the mission of the Church.</li>
<li>Liberating resources and enabling the Church to redistribute funds for the mission.</li>
