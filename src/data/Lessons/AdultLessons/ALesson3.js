<p><strong>Key Text:- </strong>For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect" (Matthew 24:24).</p>
<p><strong>Morning</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>I entered a friend's house on a hot summer day, thirsty, hungry and tired. I reached out for a glass of water, then turning to the dining table, I saw lovely golden apples in a bowl. Salivating, I stretched out my hand to pick just one. What a disappointment when I touched them; they were fake apples! Plastic apples so well manufactured as to deceive a hungry me. The last days will be filled with deception in the religious arena. Jesus said, "For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect" Matthew 24:24. We need to know as individuals how God reveals Himself and study the genuine so closely that we will not be confused by the last-day counterfeits.</p>
<p>Revelation and Inspiration is a broad theological area of study. Humans alone cannot know God, and he has to reveal himself. "Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?&nbsp;It is as high as Heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than hell; what canst thou know?&nbsp;The measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea." Job 11:7-9, Thus Zophar challenged Job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Lesson will focus on The Prophetic Gift through which God revealed Himself and His will to his people. It is important to note that God used both canonical (e.g. Daniel, Isaiah, Amos etc.) and none canonical (e.g. Miriam, Nathan, Agabus etc.) prophets to communicate to his people. The Bible states that Prophetic Gift will be there until the end of time. This Lesson aims to help the believer to be able to distinguish between the genuine and the counterfeit Gift of Prophecy as we near the end of time. The following concepts will be discussed:</p>
<ol>
<li>A) God's Self-Revelation</li>
<li>B) The Importance of the Prophetic Gift</li>
<li>C) The Remnant to be Guided by the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy</li>
<li>D) The Devil's Counterfeits to God's End-Time Prophetic Gift</li>
<li>E) Testing the Prophets</li>
<li>F) Fundamental Belief 18 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church</li>
</ol>
<p>May this Lesson lead us to have a better understanding of what the Bible teaches about last-day events, especially about God's End-Time Prophetic Gift for His Church.</p>
<p><strong>Section A</strong></p>
<p><strong>God's Self-Revelation</strong></p>
<p><strong>God reveals Himself to man in many ways. Discuss some of the ways.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Revelation through nature or sometimes referred to as the General Revelation</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Psalm 19:1:- The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Romans 1:19-20:- Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.&nbsp;20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Acts 14:15-17:- And saying Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made Heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:&nbsp;16 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.&nbsp;17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from Heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: In the heavens above, in the earth, in the broad waters of the ocean, we see the handiwork of God. All created things testify to His power, His wisdom, His love. &ndash; {Ministry of Healing p. 419.3}</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Revelation through human relationships&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Isaiah 66:13:- As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 Corinthians 11:2 NKJV:- For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Psalm 103:13-14:- Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.&nbsp;14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: God has bound our hearts to Him by unnumbered tokens in Heaven and in earth. Through the things of nature, and the deepest and tenderest earthly ties that human hearts can know, He has sought to reveal Himself to us. Yet these but imperfectly represent His love. &ndash; {Steps to Christ p.10.3}</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Revelation through Christ</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>John 14:9:- Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 Corinthians 4:6:- For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hebrews 1:1-3 NKJV:- God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: God saw that a clearer revelation than nature was needed to portray both His personality and His character. He sent His Son into the world to manifest, so far as could be endured by human sight, the nature and the attributes of the invisible God. &ndash; {Ministry of Healing p.419.4}</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Revelation through the Scriptures&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>John 5:39:- Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 Timothy 3:16-17:- All scripture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:&nbsp;17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 Peter 1:20-21:- Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.&nbsp;21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hebrews 1:1 NKJV:- God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by human hands; and in the varied style of its different books it presents the characteristics of the several writers. The truths revealed are all "given by inspiration of God" (2 Timothy 3:16); yet they are expressed in the words of men. The Infinite One by His Holy Spirit has shed light into the minds and hearts of His servants. He has given dreams and visions, symbols and figures; and those to whom the truth was thus revealed, have themselves embodied the thought in human language. &ndash; {The Faith I Live By p. 10.3}</em></p>
<p><em>In His word, God has committed to men the knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be accepted as an authoritative, infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the revealer of doctrines, and the test of experience. "Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work."&nbsp;2 Timothy 3:16, 17, R.V. &ndash; {Great Controversy p.vii.1}</em></p>
<p><strong>Section B</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Importance of The Prophetic Gift</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What did the Apostle Paul say about the importance of the prophetic gift</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1 Corinthians 14:1 NKJV; "Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1 Thessalonians 5:20-21; Despise not prophesyings.&nbsp;21Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>How has God guided his people in the past?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Amos 3:7; Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.&nbsp;8 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? The Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: "The Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants and prophets." While "the secret things belong unto the Lord our God," "those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever."&nbsp;Amos 3:7;&nbsp;Deuteronomy 29:29. God has given these things to us, and His blessing will attend the reverent, prayerful study of the prophetic scriptures. &ndash; {Desire of Ages p. 234.3}</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Were the people always happy with the prophets of God?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 23:37; O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Amos 2:11:- And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? Saith the LORD.&nbsp;12 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 Kings 17:13-14:- Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.&nbsp;14 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> What admonition was given by King Jehoshaphat to his people that is relevant to us today?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>2 Chronicles 20:20:- And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>What Mode of communication was used by God to communicate to his prophets?&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Numbers 12:6:- And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hosea 12:10:- I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Who chooses Prophets?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Jeremiah 1:4-5, Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,&nbsp;5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Amos 7:14-15:- Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:&nbsp;15 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 Peter 1:19-21:- We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:&nbsp;20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.&nbsp;21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>What complaint did God have about false prophets during the days of Jeremiah?&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Jeremiah 23:21-22:- I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.&nbsp;22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jeremiah 29:8-9:- For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.&nbsp;9 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section C</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Remnant to be Guided by the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What does the Prophet Joel say about the last days?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Joel 2:28-29:-And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:&nbsp;29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Joel predicts that in the last days, God's people will prophesy and see dreams and visions.&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>What signs did Joel use to mark the last days?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Joel 2:30-32 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.&nbsp;31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.&nbsp;32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>How did Peter explain the prophecy of Joel?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Acts 2:16-21:- But this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel;&nbsp;17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:&nbsp;18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:&nbsp;19 And I will shew wonders in Heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:&nbsp;20The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:&nbsp;21And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>How did Jesus agree with Joel and Peter about the beginning of the last days?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 24:29-30:- Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from Heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:&nbsp;30 And then shall appear the sign of the son of man in Heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven with power and great glory.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>What added insights does the book of Revelation give on these signs?&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Revelation 6:12-17:- And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;&nbsp;13 And the stars of Heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.&nbsp;14 And the Heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.&nbsp;15 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;&nbsp;16 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:&nbsp;17 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The great earthquake, the darkening of the sun, and the moon turning into blood happen just before the second coming of Christ. This is the period that Joel saw the gift of prophecy being exercised in the remnant. The fulfilment of these signs are documented in History. The Lisbon earthquake 1755, the darkening of the sun and moon turning into blood 1780 and the unprecedented falling of stars 1833.</em></p>

<li><strong>According to Revelation, what will be the identifying marks of the Remnant people of God.</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Revelation 12:17:- And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>What is the testimony of Jesus?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Revelation 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of prophecy.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>According to Joel, who will exercise this gift of prophecy in the last days?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Joel 2:28-29 NIV, "And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions. Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days."</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: This promise is gender and age inclusive, as the Old and New Testaments demonstrate.</em></p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>What examples can we cite of young man prophesying in the Bible?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Jeremiah 1:4-7:- Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,&nbsp;5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.&nbsp;6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.&nbsp;7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1 Samuel 3:9-11:- Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.&nbsp;10 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.&nbsp;11 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1 Samuel 3:19-21:- And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.&nbsp;20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beer&ndash;sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.&nbsp;21 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong>What examples can we cite of young and old women prophesying in the Bible?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Acts 22:8-9:- And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto C&aelig;sarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.&nbsp;9And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Luke 2:36-37:- And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;&nbsp;37And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.&nbsp;38And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2 Kings 22:13-16:- Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.&nbsp;14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.&nbsp;15 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,&nbsp;16Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section D</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Devil's Counterfeits to God's End-Time Prophetic Gift</strong></p>
<p>While the Bible states clearly that the prophetic gift will guide God's Remnant people, it also warns us repeatedly of false prophets in the last days, just like there were false prophets of old.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What did Peter say about false prophets? Past, Present and Future</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>2 Peter 2:1-2:- But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.&nbsp;2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Are there examples of false Male and Female prophets in the Bible?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Nehemiah 6:12-14:- And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.&nbsp;13Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.&nbsp;14 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>1 Kings 13:18-20:- He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.&nbsp;19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Revelation 2:20:- Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Which was the first sign that Jesus gave about his second coming?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 24:3-5:- And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?&nbsp;4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.&nbsp;5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>How did Jesus further emphasize the dangers of false prophets and christs in the last days</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 24:11-13:- And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.&nbsp;12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.&nbsp;13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 24:23-27:- Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.&nbsp;24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.&nbsp;25Behold, I have told you before.&nbsp;26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.&nbsp;27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the son of man be.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 7:15:- Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section E</strong></p>
<p><strong>Testing the Prophets</strong></p>
<p>While we should not discount the gift of prophecy because false prophets abound, we should be able to distinguish between the genuine and the counterfeit through God's word. The Bible says, "Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good" 1 Thessalonians 5:20-21. Testing is needed so we can hold on to what is good. 'Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world." 1 John 4:1. The following are biblical tests to be applied to the experience of one who claims to be a prophet.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Harmony with scriptures</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is to be our guide in spiritual matters?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Psalm 119:105:- Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Isaiah 8:20:- To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</li>

<p><strong>Fundamental Belief 18 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the ages, God has used the gift of prophecy to guide his children to know and do his will. The Bible states that in the end time, God will use this gift again for the edification of his church. Unfortunately, the Devil will also counterfeit the gift and cause religious confusion by mixing truth with error. We, therefore, need to test those who claim to be prophets by the word of God. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. Isaiah 8:20</p>
<p>Among the 28 Fundamental Beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is belief Number 18, which reads:</p>
<p><strong>BELIEF 18: THE GIFT OF PROPHECY</strong></p>
<p>The Scriptures testify that one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church, and we believe it was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. Her writings speak with prophetic authority and provide comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction to the church. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (Num. 12:6; 2 Chron. 20:20; Amos 3:7; Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 12:17; 19:10; 22:8, 9.) <a href="https://www.adventist.org/gift-of-prophecy/">https://www.adventist.org/gift-of-prophecy/</a></p>
<p>The tests of a prophet were rigorously applied to Ellen G. White's experience before the church accepted her prophetic gift. It is beyond the scope of our Lesson to apply in detail the prophetic tests of her experience; however, we shall pick a few examples on each test.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Harmony with Scriptures</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Ellen White never advocated that her writings should replace the Bible; she saw them as "a lesser light" that leads to "the greater" which is the Bible. "The Lord has sent His people much instruction, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little. Little heed is given to the Bible, and the Lord has given a lesser light to lead men and women to the greater light. Oh, how much good would be accomplished if the books containing this light were read with a determination to carry out the principles they contain! There would be a thousandfold greater vigilance and more self-denial and resolute effort. And many more would now be rejoicing in the light of present truth." &ndash; {Colporteur Ministry p. 125.2}</p>
<p>The work of higher criticism, in dissecting, conjecturing, and reconstructing, is destroying faith in the Bible as a divine revelation. It is robbing God's word of power to control, uplift, and inspire human lives. &ndash; {Acts of the Apostles p. 474.1}</p>
<p>There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigour to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times. &ndash; {Steps to Christ p. 90.1}</p>
<p>But God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and the Bible only, as the standard of all doctrines and the basis of all reforms. &ndash; {Great Controversy p. 595.1}</p>
<p>Keep your Bible with you. As you have opportunity, read it; fix the texts in your memory. Even while you are walking the streets you may read a passage and meditate upon it, thus fixing it in the mind. &ndash; {Steps to Christ p. 90.2}</p>

<li><strong>Confess and Glorify Christ</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One needs only to read Ellen Whites books such as The Desire of Ages and The Steps to Christ to see that she confessed and glorified Christ.</p>
<p>"Lift up Jesus, you that teach the people, lift Him up in sermon, in song, in prayer. Let all your powers be directed to pointing souls, confused, bewildered, lost, to "the Lamb of God." Lift Him up, the risen Saviour, and say to all who hear, Come to Him who "hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us." [Ephesians 5:2.] Let the science of salvation be the burden of every sermon, the theme of every song. Let it be poured forth in every supplication. Bring nothing into your preaching to supplement Christ, the wisdom and power of God. Hold forth the word of life, presenting Jesus as the hope of the penitent and the stronghold of every believer. Reveal the way of peace to the troubled and the despondent, and show forth the grace and completeness of the Saviour." &ndash; {Gospel Workers p. 160.1}</p>

<li><strong>Confirmation of Fulfilled Prophecy&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While the duty of a prophet goes far beyond the prediction of the future, even if a prophet does make any predictions, they must come true. It is also important to note that some prophecies are conditional, like in the case of Jonah and Nineveh. The prophecies made by Ellen White about the future can be validated. We shall cite a few:</p>
<p><strong>The American Civil War Predication</strong></p>
<p>In January 12, 1861 just before the civil war started, when many doubted it would ever be, she predicted that the civil war was coming and fulfilled three months later.</p>
<p>"There is not a person in this house who has even dreamed of the trouble that is coming upon this land. People are making sport of the secession ordinance of South Carolina, but I have just been shown that a large number of States are going to join that State, and there will be a most terrible war. In this vision I have seen large armies of both sides gathered on the field of battle. I heard the booming of the cannon, and saw the dead and dying on every hand&hellip;. There are those in this house who will lose sons in that war." &ndash; {General Conference Daily Bulletin January 31, 1893}</p>
<p><em>On April 12, 1861, the first salvos of the American Civil War were fired with the bombardment of the U.S. garrison at Fort Sumter, located in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. It stood as one of the last Federal outposts in the region.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civil-war-in-america/april-1861-april-1862.html"><em>https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civil-war-in-america/april-1861-april-1862.html</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Labour Unions Predication: We are seeing this predication fulfilled every day worldwide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ellen White Statement:</strong></p>
<p>"The time is fast coming when the controlling power of the labour&nbsp;unions will be very oppressive. Again and again the Lord has instructed that our people are to take their families away from the cities, into the country, where they can raise their own provisions; for in the future the problem of buying and selling will be a very serious one." &ndash; {Country Living p. 9.5}</p>

<p><em>"We need tough and decisive action to limit trade unions' ability to paralyze our economy," Truss, who is the frontrunner in the prime ministerial contest, said in a statement.

<p><strong>Unity of Protestants with the Papacy Before the Close of History</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ellen White's statement:</strong></p>
<p>When Protestantism shall stretch her hand across the gulf to grasp the hand of the Roman power, when she shall reach over the abyss to clasp hands with spiritualism, when, under the influence of this threefold union, our country shall repudiate every principle of its Constitution as a Protestant and republican government and shall make provision for the propagation of papal falsehoods and delusions, then we may know that the time has come for the marvellous working of Satan and that the end is near. &ndash; {Last Day Events p. 131.4}</p>

Less than two months after, the Pope sent a video message to Copeland, and the leaders at his leadership conference, encouraging Charismatics everywhere and Charismatic Catholics to unite. But this was not the typical ecumenical message. Liberal Episcopal Bishop Tony Palmer (pictured far right) introduced the Pope's message by saying that the Protestant protest is over, so now we are all Catholics.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://thewordonthewordoffaith.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/kenneth-copeland-takes-an-ecumenical-trip-to-the-vatican-and-meet-pope-francis/"><em>https://thewordonthewordoffaith.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/kenneth-copeland-takes-an-ecumenical-trip-to-the-vatican-and-meet-pope-francis/</em></a></p>
<p><strong>HEALTH STATEMENTS: ELLEN WHITE MADE MANY STATEMENTS ON HEALTH THAT WERE FAR BEYOND HER TIME. WE SHALL NOTE ONLY A FEW.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tobacco </strong>(Ellen White's statements were made at a time when tobacco was not seen as dangerous at all)</p>
<p><strong>Ellen White Comments:</strong></p>
<p>Tobacco, in whatever form it is used, tells upon the Constitution. It is a slow poison. It affects the brain and benumbs the sensibilities so that the mind cannot discern spiritual things, especially those truths which would have a tendency to correct this filthy indulgence. Those who use tobacco in any form are not clear before God.&hellip; &ndash; {Healthful Living p. 109.5}</p>
<p>Tobacco is a poison of the most deceitful and malignant kind, having an exciting, then a paralyzing, influence upon the nerves of the body. It is all the more dangerous because its effects upon the system are so slow, and at first scarcely perceivable &ndash; {Healthful Living p. 110.1}</p>
<p><strong><em>Current observations:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>All parts of the tobacco plant are poisonous because of the chemicals in the leaves, stems, and flowers.&hellip; Tobacco plants may also contain other toxic chemicals found in the soil, like cadmium and lead. They may also contain nitrates picked up from fertilizers.&hellip; Inhaling, eating, or smoking cultivated tobacco leaves can cause nicotine poisoning. Nicotine poisoning is extremely dangerous, especially if you ingest a large amount of nicotine. Nicotine binds to specific receptors in your body that are found throughout your nervous system and at the connection between the nervous system and muscles. </em><a href="https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/tobacco-poisoning"><em>https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/tobacco-poisoning</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Drinking Water</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ellen White comments:</strong></p>
<p>In health and in sickness, pure water is one of Heaven's choicest blessings. Its proper use promotes health. It is the beverage which God provided to quench the thirst of animals and man. Drunk freely, it helps to supply the necessities of the system and assists nature to resist disease. &ndash; {Ministry of Healing p. 237.1}</p>
<p><strong><em>Current Observations:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Drinking water does more than just quench your thirst. It's essential to keeping your body functioning properly and feeling healthy.</em><em>Nearly all of your body's major systems depend on water to function and survive. With water making up about 60% of your body weight, it's no surprise what staying hydrated can do for you.</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/water-essential-to-your-body"><em>https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/water-essential-to-your-body</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Meat Eating and Cancer&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ellen White comments:</strong></p>
<p>Cancers, tumours, and pulmonary diseases are largely caused by meat eating.&ndash; {Counsels on Diet and Foods p.383.4}</p>
<p>Flesh was never the best food; but its use is now doubly objectionable, since disease in animals is so rapidly increasing. Those who use flesh foods little know what they are eating. Often if they could see the animals when living and know the quality of the meat they eat, they would turn from it with loathing. People are continually eating flesh that is filled with tuberculous and cancerous germs. Tuberculosis, cancer, and other fatal diseases are thus communicated. &ndash; {Ministry of Healing p. 313.2}</p>
<p><strong><em>Current Observations on Cancer:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><em>If you've given any thought to cancer prevention, you have probably thought about your diet. Almost every week a new trend is hitting the health food headlines. It can make it almost impossible to settle on what to eat and not eat.</em></p>
<p><em>But there is one diet that is consistently proven, over more than two decades, to reduce your risk for cancer. It is a plant-based diet.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/5-benefits-of-a-plant-based-diet.h20-1592991.html"><em>https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/5-benefits-of-a-plant-based-diet.h20-1592991.html</em></a></p>

<p><strong>Tea and Coffee</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ellen White comments:</strong></p>
<p>In relation to tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcoholic drinks, the only safe course is to touch not, taste not, handle not. The tendency of tea, coffee, and similar drinks is in the same direction as that of alcoholic liquor and tobacco, and in some cases the habit is as difficult to break as it is for the drunkard to give up intoxicants. Those who attempt to leave off these stimulants will for a time feel a loss and will suffer without them. But by persistence they will overcome the craving and cease to feel the lack. Nature may require a little time to recover from the abuse she has suffered; but give her a chance, and she will again rally and perform her work nobly and well. &ndash; {MH 335.3}</p>
<p><strong><em>Current Observations:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Rashi Chahal, Nutritionist, Rosewalk Healthcare. Here's what she tells Health Shots, "Caffeine can affect children's heart, brain, kidney, liver, and their well-being.&hellip;" It's essential to understand that caffeine is not just present in coffee or tea. It is an integral component in sweets, drinks, bakery foods, chocolates, and cookies. Chahal says that caffeine impacts the absorption of healthier food in children, and since they need more vitamins and minerals for their development, their health is impacted.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.healthshots.com/mom-says/side-effects-of-caffeine-why-are-coffee-and-tea-bad-for-childrens-health/"><em>https://www.healthshots.com/mom-says/side-effects-of-caffeine-why-are-coffee-and-tea-bad-for-childrens-health/</em></a></p>
<p><strong>COMMENT FROM DR. CLIVE MCCAY, A SCIENTIST AND PROFESSOR OF NUTRITION AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY, WHO READ ELLEN WHITE BOOKS ON HEALTH:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>When one reads such works by Mrs. White as Ministry of Healing or Counsels on Diet and Foods he is impressed by the correctness of her teachings in the light of modern nutritional science. One can only speculate how much better health the average American might enjoy, even though he knew almost nothing of modern science, if he but followed the teachings of Mrs. White.&mdash;Review and Herald, February 12, 1959.&nbsp;</em></p>

<li><strong>By their Fruits you shall know them - A Godly life </strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For this, we need to pick on one of the public newspapers&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>"The life of Mrs. White is an example worthy of emulation by all. Though of limited education, for the greater part of her long life in poor health, she never faltered, but for seventy-two years carried and preached the message of Jesus Christ, as understood by her, to the farthermost corners of the earth. She was a humble, devout disciple of Christ, and ever went about doing good. Her writings have been published in books, papers, and periodicals. She was revered by all the members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and honoured and respected by all who appreciate noble womanhood consecrated to unselfish labour for the uplifting and betterment of mankind. Her death marks the calling of another noted leader of religious thought, and one whose almost ninety years were full to overflowing with good deeds, kind words, and earnest prayers for all mankind."&mdash;Editorial in the St. Helena (Calif.) Star, July 25, 1915. </em><a href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/648.799"><em>https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/648.799</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In this study, we have looked at how God endeavours to communicate with his children in preparation for the Second Coming of Christ. The Gift of Prophecy plays a paramount role in this communication and will exist; it will exist until the end of time. Unfortunately, the Devil has many counterfeits to this gift, and thus we have to be able to apply the biblical tests for a prophet in order to avoid deception. We are to be like the Bereans who examined the scriptures daily, "Now these Jews were nobler than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the scriptures daily to see if these things were so" Acts 17:11 RSV. On any of our beliefs, we must give thorough study so that individually we can give a reason for our faith. "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defence to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope in you, with meekness and fear;" 1 Peter 3:15 NKJV.</p>
<p>Our only safeguard in these last days is the word of God. "Paul declared, looking down to the last days: "The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine."&nbsp;2 Timothy 4:3. That time has fully come. The multitudes do not want Bible truth because it interferes with the desires of the sinful, world-loving heart, and Satan supplies the deceptions they love. &ndash; {Great Controversy p. 594.2}. Nevertheless, God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and the Bible only, as the standard of all doctrines and the basis of all reforms. The opinions of learned men, the deductions of science, the creeds or decisions of ecclesiastical councils, as numerous and discordant as are the churches which they represent, the voice of the majority&mdash;not one nor all of these should be regarded as evidence for or against any point of religious faith. Before accepting any doctrine or precept, we should demand a plain "Thus saith the Lord" in its support."&ndash; {Great Controversy p. 595.1}.</p>
