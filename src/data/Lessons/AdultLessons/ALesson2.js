<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>EVANGELISM OUR REASON FOR EXISTENCE</strong></p>
<p>God's mission for this world motivates and informs our mission. For this reason, the mission is the lifeblood of the Seventh-day Adventist church. The mission is woven into our identity, defining who we are and why we exist<strong><em>. SID Working Policy A20.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Greek English dictionary, the mission is the vocation or calling of a religious organisation, especially a Christian one, to go out into the world and spread its faith. The same dictionary defines evangelism as spreading the Christian gospel by public preaching or personal witness. In this study, we will appreciate how we, as Christians, can fulfil the mandate of God in spreading the Gospel. The SID Working Policy goes on the say; At its core, the mission is bearing witness through word and life and in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>If the Church exists for mission as a mandate from the creator, mission and evangelism must be about Jesus Christ and the plan of redemption. Evangelism must be how humanity must access life and eternal salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as King and Savior. The lesson study shall focus on exalting Jesus Christ through the remnant Church, Evangelism, and promulgating the three Angels' messages.</p>
<p>Evangelism is a divine mandate from God to humanity, especially the Church on Earth because the Church exists for the Gospel and its proliferation into the world. The essence of evangelism is when Christ's presence is appreciated, and His grace is made available to those with the image of GOD universally. Knowing, worshipping, and obeying Christ will make salvation a blessed possibility. It is the sacred mandate of the Church- fulfilling its mission by revealing the redeemer and unfurling the glories of a transformative life<em>. "My Father has been working until now, and I have been working" John 5:20. </em>The Church's I will go initiative is consonant with <strong>lifting Jesus from the Earth.</strong></p>
<p>The following are the objectives of this section of the Lesson: -</p>
<ol>
<li>To understand what evangelism is and how to practice it practically.</li>
<li>Understanding essential qualities of evangelists from the writings of Ellen White.</li>
<li>Appreciating Christ's methods of evangelism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, evangelism becomes the essence of all our lives if we are committed to following Christ and serving others in a biblically appropriate way. According to 1saiah 61:1, effective evangelism is the proclamation of the word of God by those that are moved and possessed of the Divine Spirit. It sends hope to a world groping in the darkness of diseases, wars, spiritual darkness, lawlessness, crime, and chaos. From the time of the Israelite's evangelism, the messages of hope to the world were modelled by ethical holy living. Gentiles and foreigners to the nation of Israel were attracted to Jehovah by the moral qualities demonstrated by His people.</p>
<p>Like the patriarch Abraham, his family was a household of great piety, so much so that his neighbours could notice that God blessed him. King Solomon's God-given wisdom attracted the attention of the queen of Sheba. Proselytes were non-Jews who fully converted to Judaism and embraced all the spiritual responsibilities required of the Jews. Jonah 3:2, Matt 4:17, Matt 4:23, and Matt 11:5 tell us that individuals, groups, and families can minister to others and souls are saved. Evangelism is a way of life that God considers as a life worth living. It is a ministry done to others living on Earth whose rewards are of eternal significance.</p>
<p>The significance of evangelism in the patriarchal era and in the prophetic dispensation is noteworthy that while prophets were more concerned with national piety and holy living, all that was designed to make Israel a nation, a better witness for Christ then and in the future. With this background, it is crucial to consider some essential critical qualities of evangelists.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Success is the result of order and harmonious action. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our connection with the work of God demands availability, willingness, ability, and expertise. Excellence as a virtue and a value is vital in mission fulfilment. In her book, Evangelism, Ellen White writes: <em>"Everything connected with Heaven is in perfect order&hellip;all who work for Him are to labour intelligently, not in a careless, haphazard manner. He [GOD] would have His work done with faith and exactness, that He may place His seal of approval upon it." [Evangelism 93.2]</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Forethought and earnest prayer</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Evangelism is the function of having a vision and foresight. It is a work in which commitment consultation and study are crucial for the best results. Ellen White goes on to say: "It is a sin to be heedless, purposeless, and indifferent in any work in which we may engage, but especially in the work of God. every enterprise connected with His cause should be carried forward with order foresight and earnest prayer." Review and Herald March 18, 1884 [Evangelism 94.4]</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Discipline and efficiency</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Discipline is training people to obey rules or a code of behaviour, while efficiency denotes achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense. A look at the definition of the two words, it is worth noting that teamwork in evangelism in the work of God will result in efficiency and effectiveness in mission fulfilment. Ellen White informs us, "Let us remember that we are labourers together with God. We are not wise enough to work by ourselves. God Has made us His stewards to prove us and to try us&hellip; He will not have His army composed of undisciplined, unsanctified, erratic soldiers, who will misrepresent His order and purity." Review and Herald October 8, 1901, [Evangelism 95, 2].</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exceptional service needed</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Evangelists are supposed to be people of humility and piety. Individuals that are prepared to spend and be spent for the cause of the truth. God is willing to utilise anyone willing to serve Him wholeheartedly. The value of humanity is evident when everyone seeks an opportunity to serve God. This privilege is not denied to men. Ellen White vehemently highlights the possibility of man's capacity to glorify his creator through service to Him. She states, <em>"To every man is given his work, not to glorify himself, but for the glory of God." Manuscript 25,1895- [Evangelism 95.3].</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nobility of character, a necessity</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Evangelists must manifest the purity of a noble character in proportion to the value of the Gospel they spread. A good name and nobility of character are precious in the context of the Remnant's mandate to fulfil the mission<em>. "Christian worth does not depend on brilliant talents, lofty births, wonderful powers, but on a clean heart purified and refined, that does not exalt self, but by beholding Christ, reflects the long-lost image of divinity." Letter 16. 1902. </em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Have confidence in the Church.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><u>T</u>he gospel messengers are never to be hostile and to be antagonistic to the Church as an organisation. The patriarchs, Apostles and the prophets endorsed it, and so did Christ. All these authoritative figures were concerned with mission and not with confounding men concerning the plan of salvation. Ellen White gives us the following counsel: <em>"Let all be careful not to make an outcry against the only people [Adventist church] who are fulfilling the description given of the remnant people who keep the commandments of God and have faith in Jesus, who are exalting the standards of righteousness in the last days." GRC, 40,1</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"The Lord Has his appointed agencies and a church that has lived through persecution, conflict, and darkness. Jesus loved the Church and gave Himself for it, and He will replenish, refine, ennoble, and elevate it so that it shall stand fast amid the corrupting influence of this world." GRC 36.2</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Undergird the mind with the pure truth.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For the evangelists to effectively fulfil their missionary mandate, the mindset must be ennobled, illuminated and retentive of the tenets of the Gospel. A defective mindset results in defective perception, which will naturally lead to apostasy, fanaticism and infidelity as much as spiritual things are concerned. From the writings of Ellen White, we learn that <em>"God is not the author of confusion, but of peace. Nevertheless, Satan is an unsleeping vigilant foe, ever at work upon human minds, seeking soil to sow his tares. If he finds anyone he can press into his service, he will suggest ideas and false theories and be zealous in advocating error. The truth not only converts but works the purification of its receiver. GRC. 37,3. </em></p>
<p>Evangelism is essentially when the Bible truths influence individuals, families, institutions, and communities of believers and experience a gradual but sure growth in grace. Growing in Christ. The value of life is when individuals strive to amass virtue through ministry to others. The following thoughts from her book illustrate the point as follows. <strong><em>"</em></strong><em>The life spent on self is like the grain that is eaten. It disappears, but there is no increase. A man may gather all he can for self; but his life passes away, and he has nothing. The law of self-serving is the law of self-destruction." Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages pp 624. </em></p>
<p>Evangelism is when we learn and practice putting others first. Self-abnegation is an attribute of Christ, and it is mandatory because it is not a spiritual gift but an imperative that will ensure that the mission is fulfilled to the satisfaction of God. Unlike stagnant pools that will offend and harbour impurities, Christian Evangelists are to be like perennial rivers that spread the life and hope abroad. Christ's messengers are to teach, instruct and persuade humanity to fashion their lives after the attributes of Jesus Christ. With this background, it is time to examine how Christ modelled Evangelism during His ministry on Earth. We do well to note that there is a great cosmic conflict between good and evil, precisely between God and Satan, the devil. In Christ, we learn to be pious and valuable despite the forces of error and deception.</p>
<p><strong>Christ's deeds. </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>He worked with men of different talents to unite them in intellectual labour, the people of their time (Luke 6;13).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Christ reached all classes of people as a tender and compassionate leader (Matt 9;36 ,14;14 15;32, 18;27, Mark 1;41)</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>He had to give clear and distinct truthful messages adapted to the understanding of His hearers. He was simple, patient, and appealing, as well as authoritative. Christ was the essence of the Gospel. What He taught, He lived (John 13;15).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Christ planned His work; he understood the significance of time as very precious, especially in the context of salvation and service (John 14;12, Matt 4;17).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Love for the people prompted the Savior to meet the people where they were found. It is the essence of the incarnation. He came to identify with the despondent and the afflicted and availed Himself to gladden and illuminate the discouraged heart (Luke 4:18, Matt 22:9).</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Christ restrained the truth. In His efforts to teach, preach and instruct His followers, Christ was conscious of the limitations of their capacity to comprehend certain truths until such a time could come when they could utilise the truths given. As evangelists, this method of Christ is a necessity. It promotes harmony and the presentation of the truth in time. Ellen White states: <em>"The Great Teacher held in His hand the entire map of truth, but He did not disclose it all to his disciples. He opened to them those subjects only which were essential to their advancement in the path of Heaven. There were many things to which His wisdom kept Him silent." [Evangelism 57,4]</em>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Christ disciples and founded His Church on the scriptures, John 17:17. With this scriptural basis of His messages, He followed up on progress by sending the disciples in twos and had time to receive reports which counsel and empowerment followed.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>He utilised personal interviews with the rich young ruler, Nicodemus, John 31-3, the woman at the well John 4:7, Zacchaeus, Luke 19:5, these women from Tyre and Sidon Matt 15:21 etc. <em>"He had a faithful regard for the one soul audience, and that one soul has carried to thousands the intelligence received." </em>Ellen White <em>Review and Herald May 9, 1899. </em></li>
</ol>
<p>To summarise this section of the Lesson, one can highlight the significance of character development to accomplish the demands of the mission as stipulated in Matt 28:18ff. Christ's likeness is the goal of evangelism, and it is a winning strategy against the wiles of the evil one. Love and compassion are the vital attributes of evangelists who must make a positive influence in the world. The world needs hope, not a bleak confrontation with evil without hope and without God. Through prayer, order, discipline and having a vision and foresight for the work, evangelists will accomplish much as they depend on God. Everyone has a place in God's grand plan of redemption. Humility and piety will make evangelism a possibility.</p>
<p><strong>THE REMNANT AND ITS MISSION</strong></p>
<p>We have learned about evangelism and how Jesus Christ modelled it. We are to understand that it is out of effective evangelism that will bring about a change in the people so much that they are regarded as the remnants of and for God. We need to define the Remnant before looking at their qualities.</p>
<p><strong>Definition </strong></p>
<p>According to the Anchor Bible dictionary, the word Remnant means what is left of a community after a catastrophe. According to Hebrew, the term remnant has the following two implications.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>-Paletah- or palet</em> meaning what escapes, to escape or those who escape.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><em>-She'erith- or shear, </em>it means "the rest" or what remains, the remainder of the Remnant.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, for our study, we do well to see in all these definitions that the Remnant denotes communities which consisted of successive generations of God's chosen people in the past. These people survived calamities natural, moral as well as physical and spiritual calamities and continued steadfastly as God's representatives. God has an end-time remnant which will be faithful in the end. The calamities include but are not limited to wars, pestilences, famines, fires, floods, anarchy and apostasy.</p>
<p><strong>Biblical References to the Remnant.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Genesis 45:7, Through Joseph, the household of Jacob is preserved as a remnant of famine.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>1 King 18:22 Elijah the Tishbite considered himself the Remnant of the Lord after a general national apostasy of following &ndash; worshipping the Baals in Israel.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>2 Kings 25:22, we see a community of survivors after the Babylonian invasion of Judah. See also 2 Kings 17:18.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Ezekiel 6:8, God promises the children of Israel that He will leave or preserve a remnant while the rest suffer persecution and exile.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Revelation 12:17, The Remnant is in a cosmic with the devil as they keep the commandments of the Lord. Romans 9:27, 11:15.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this kind of biblical identity and support about who and what constitutes being part of the Remnant Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is clear when it identifies itself with the true essence of the Remnant. The following quote from the SID Working Policy sums it all up.</p>
<p><em>"The Seventh-day Adventist church sees itself as the remnant church, individually and collectively, understand their special role as ambassadors of God's kingdom and messengers of the soon return of Jesus Christ. Seventh-day Adventists have enlisted as co-workers with God in His mission of reclaiming the world from the power and presence of evil as part of the great controversy between Christ and Satan.</em><strong>" SID Working Policy A09 05.</strong>While the SDA church legitimately identifies itself with the Remnant Church according to the scriptures, it is an entity that still believes that it must evangelise the world, as is found in the Text below.</p>
<p><em>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in Heaven and on Earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen. Mathew 28:18-20 NKJV. </em></p>
<p>To sum up what is implied by Mathew 28:18-20, Ellen White states what the remnant people should do to fulfil their holy mandate. Prophets and Kings, page 678: <em>"God's remnant people, standing before the world as reformers, are to show that the law of God is the foundation of all enduring reforms, and that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is to stand as a memorial of creation, a constant reminder of the power of God. In clear, distinct lines they are to present the necessity of obedience to all the precepts of the Decalogue."</em></p>
<p><strong>Discuss with the class the characteristics of the Remnant.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are the living members of the last day church who will remain loyal to God by keeping all His commandments amidst the widespread apostasy and infidelities of the last days.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They proclaim salvation through Christ alone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They boldly announce the judgement hour- the second coming of Christ by proclaiming the three Angel's message. They preach, teach, and promote repentance and reform on Earth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They constitute the Advent movement church.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Remnant upholds the simplicity of character, depth in the truth and piety in personal conduct.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Remnant cherishes the bond of unity provided by the Holy Spirit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Remnant is prompted and motivated by the Holy Spirit and the scriptures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Remnant accomplishes greatness in service and servanthood-self-denial.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Remnant Church upholds the purity of the bible doctrines and combats error.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remnant Church will not only be conspicuous in combating doctrinal errors, formalism, and scholasticism, which denies the Bible's inspiration and relevance in our lives but must continue to embrace and expand the gains of the Reformation. To discover and advance the light consonant with the Bible's truths, advocating salvation through repentance and not penance is the sacred mandate of the Remnant Church. The Remnant must be very articulate when expounding the reality and the truths concerning baptism through emersion, immortality as the gift from Christ to be obtained after His second coming by the saints, and the clear teaching on the Sabbath of the fourth commandment as well as the sanctuary message.</p>
<p><strong>The Remnant Church and its disciplining mandate</strong></p>
<p>To be the Remnant of God means that one is individually a disciple of God. <strong><em>"A disciple experiences continual transformation towards the fulness of Christ in a Biblically faithful way, in a culturally appropriate way, at the worldview level, in personal spirituality, in emotional wholeness, in personal lifestyle, in family relationships as a member of the body of Christ, and as a disciple-making disciple." </em></strong>[ Marcos Antonio, Discipling, nurturing, and reclaiming pp52.] With this definition of a disciple, we also see the very attributes of the Remnant. These people grow in grace daily in a culturally appropriate way, as well as fidelity to the scriptures and ethical living. They remain steadfast in the faith, while others of little faith falter and decline spiritually. The Remnant become disciples or the Remnant when faithfulness and witnessing for Christ are unchanging attributes.</p>
<p>Discipleship is an experience of whoever is constantly growing in Christ through a consistent daily devotion to Him. It is based on the universal power, authority, and the undisputed sovereignty of Jesus Christ. Discipleship is the essence of demonstrating love for one another in the Lord<strong><em>. "Jesus is the perfect combination between being and doing, His </em></strong>personality and character were one. His great work was the result of His<strong><em> character&hellip; success in mission depends on the Holy Spirit's control in us- a character in transformation and strategies based on inspired principles". [ Marcos Antonio, Discipling, nurturing and reclaiming pp52.]</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Remnant should not become a group of hermits and members of a monastery or a sect defiant to the rule of law and order, nor should they shun the world and preserve their perceived purity in their community. Instead, the Remnant must seek inner transformation Matt 5 and Chapter 10.</p>
<p>There must be a conscious readiness by the Remnant Church to utilise the culturally available and appropriate methods and modes of instruction. It is discipline. Christ used the current customs of His time to convey His messages. He could sit down to read from the sacred scriptures and use stories, parables, proverbs, sermons, and personal encounters with potential believers. <em>[adapted from Golden R. Ross, Discipling, nurturing and reclaiming pp120].</em></p>
<p>There could not be an effective remnant if the qualities and attributes of discipline and retaining the reclaimed are missing or ignored. The Remnant is a missionary force which must take the world through an aggressive and harmless missionary initiative, reaching the world with the Gospel of the Kingdom<em>. "A fully trained student becomes like his teacher. A disciple is like his master Luke 6: 40. Imitating the master in all aspects&hellip; A true disciple applies the word of God to all cultural issues that are out of step with what Jesus would do if faced with similar situations." [ibid pp122.</em>] it is the mission of the Remnant Church. It must reveal the character of God to the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Afternoon</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The attributes of a successful discipleship initiative</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It must be intentional</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Discipling, nurturing and retaining the converted is a severe duty to be done thoroughly by the Remnant. It is a work that must be systematic and planned to make it practically possible for Bible-based teachings. It is when initiatives are made about how effectively the word of God can be broadcast to the world.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>It must be formational.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Bible study is incomplete whenever it ends with informational data, but it must be formational when lessons are derived from the texts' narratives and applied to our lives. One must learn about humanity, God, mission, and the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>It must build around a community.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Remnant has a mission to teach the world through families, clans, tribes, and people groups. It is relational discipleship, where the concerns of a particular group can be discussed, analysed, and inspected without offence to the group members. It is when the mission faces the reality of people's concerns, such as stigma, threats, grief, addictions, failure, success, and spiritual maturity of declension.<strong> "As the disciples of Christ, we must diffuse light which we know the world has not. Let the people of God be rich in works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may hold on to eternal life." [ Ministers pp24-42. GRC 19.2]</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>It must address all areas of life and be contextual. </strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The gospel message must not be packaged into a compartmentalised framework where in some respects, it is rendered irrelevant and, in some respects, regarded as authoritative. It is when the Gospel is adapted to address specific challenges in specific cultural contexts. Discipline and discipleship are very fundamental to the existence of the Remnant Church as a way of fulfilling its missionary mandate. The Remnant Church must know the difference between believers\members and the disciples. The following contrast demonstrates that.</p>

<p><strong>Some more counsel from Ellen white </strong></p>
<p>The faithful followers of God who keep his commandments are never alone but are under the guardianship of the Holy Angels. The Remnant and the disciples are on a spiritual journey that will result in ascending to Heaven when Jesus shall come the second time to end sin and suffering. Being a disciple and a remnant Christian means leading a virtuous life in a sinful and tempting world. Ellen White stresses the point: <strong><em>"God is leading a people out of the world upon the exalted platform of eternal truth, the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. He will discipline and lift His people. They will not be at variance, one believing one thing and another having faith and views opposite, each moving independently of the body..." [GRC17.2]</em></strong>. The commandments of Jesus and the truth must strengthen the brotherhood or the fraternity of all believers in establishing the unit in faith with no room for fragmenting.</p>
<p>The Remnant are disciples; as such, they should ensure that the work of mission is not disrupted and the missionaries are not distracted from appreciating the essence of their calling.</p>
<p><strong>How should members of the remnant Church respond or act when one of them receives "new light"?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How can the "new light" be harmonised with the old truths and the principles and policies of the Church? </strong></p>
<p>We are now in the final phase of our Lesson. We are focusing on the work of the remnant people of God from a prophetic point of view. The book of Revelation, in chapter 14, sums up the work of the remnant believers in a symbolic way. The faithful believers will spread the three angels' messages of Revelation 14 to warn the world and prepare it to meet Christ at His second coming. In prophetic writings, the angels of Revelation 14 symbolise God's messengers; in this case, they are faithful remnant believers. We learn that the remnant believers have a work that will end with the world's end. Ellen White says<strong><em>, "The closing work of the Gospel is represented in prophecy as being accomplished by three Angels with the important messages of present truth. The angels represent the people who accept the light of God's messages and go forth as His agents to sound the warning through the length and breadth of the world." Testimonies volume 5pp 455-456.</em></strong></p>
<p>NB: The end-time crisis and conflicts will not deny the people the worship practice, but the great controversy will be based on who should be worshipped, God or the devil. The three angels' messages are designed to distinguish clearly the true from the false worship of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THE THREE ANGELS' MESSAGES</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The First Angel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Memory text</strong><em>: "Then I saw another angel flying amid heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth to every nation, tribe tongue and people saying with a loud voice, "Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgement has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water." [Revelation 14;6-7 NKJV.</em></p>
<p><strong>According to Revelation14, 6-7, what is the significance of the following concepts in mission fulfilment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Purity</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Having a target audience</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Communication [clarity and audibility]</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reverence and devotion to God</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Having the commodity of value [the Gospel]?</li>
</ul>
<p>This Text's message is a symbol of God's remnant Church carrying the everlasting Gospel to the world. It is a call to repentance as well as a call to show the love of God to humanity. [Hebrews 4;2<em>] "For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it."</em></p>
<p>The First Angel's message is a symbolic way of calling the Remnant Church to a literal service to God through ministering to the lost humanity. When the Church is faithful to its core values, such as sacrifice, integrity, prayer and Bible study, excellence, and relevance, it is faithful in its mission fulfilment initiatives. <em>"By this, my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be my disciples. John 15: 9."</em></p>
<p>The fruits of the Spirit articulated in Galatians 5:22 are here by the constitution of the First Angel's message. The fruits are not gifts but a compulsory component of the attributes of those who form the Remnant Church. The Remnant Church is not to work in obscurity and secrecy, but her works and profession must be visible and convincing acts of faith that can convert the erring without disputes. It would be the practical fulfilment of the vision of John the Revelator, for he "saw" the angel in action.</p>
<p>The First Angel's message is a severe sacred appeal for the sacred stewardship of our lives. 1 Corinthians 9; 19- 20. It is a call to the purity of men's spiritual, mental, and physical state. The hour of the judgment gives an urgency to the need for repentance. Matt 16; 27, Rom 6:23, Rev 22:12. The judgement hour proclaims judgement on all apostate entities Dan 7:9-11, 26, Rev 17:8. The righteous judge wants the true and pure worship restored through the sacredness of His creatorship. It is not only the restoration of true worship alone but the restoration of humanity to the image of God in obedience. The Sabbath of the fourth commandment is now exalted, rendering all false religions and science invalid and unnecessary.</p>

<p><strong>The Second Angel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Text<em>:</em></strong><em> "Another angel followed, saying, "Babylon is fallen, that great city, because she has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."</em> Revelation 14;8. <strong>2Peter 2;1-4</strong><strong>talks about false prophets and teachers. </strong></p>
<p><strong>List what these false prophets and teachers will do and the natural results that will come, and discuss with the class. </strong></p>
<p>It is the sacred duty of the remnant Church of God to inform the world that all kinds and ways of showing defiance to God and His commandments are futile and are destined to perdition. Apostasy and rebellion against God have only one fate; destruction and death, Genesis 11;1-9. All that originates with Satan [the invisible leader of apostasy and rebellion] will fall Isa 14;4, 12-14. It is the message of the Remnant Church to the world. The Second Angel's message symbolises the nature and outcome of the great cosmic conflict between Christ and the devil, the good and the evil, the righteous and the wicked. Intoxicating wine from an infidel woman symbolises false and fictitious teachings from apostate religious organisations that have spread broadcast worldwide. The false teachings from the apostate religious entities are forced upon the world, and deception is used many times without a number. The unholy union between the state and the Church is defined as harlotry or fornication. It is a union that will lead to oppression and persecution of those that disagree with the heretical teachings that will be spreading. The falling of Babylon is because of disobedience to the God who created it.</p>
<p>A clean and virtuous woman [Church] is united to her Master Jesus alone. It is discipleship and discipline. Ezekiel 16:15, James 4:4. While fornication is mortifying and tragic, unity with Christ will give life to His disciples. The prophecy of Babylon's fall finds its fulfilment in the departure of Protestantism at large from the purity and simplicity of the Gospel of righteousness by faith- the very initiative that moved the Reformation. The falling of Babylon does not mean lessening sinfulness in her camp but rather the increase of unbelief, insolence, apostasy and rebellion that will lead to destruction. It is noteworthy that sin and sinners will not triumph or plague the world forever, but their fate is death unless timely personal repentance is evident.</p>
<p><strong>The Third Angel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Text<em>: "</em></strong><em>Then a third angel followed them, saying, with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name." Revelation 14;9-11. </em></p>
<p><strong>Read and discuss the following texts and analyse how thoughts can defile a soul. Matt 9:4, Matt 15:19, Matt 7:21, James 2:4. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What obligation do we have to ensure that our thoughts are pure and acceptable before God according to the following texts? Matt 5:8, 1 Timothy 1:5, 2 Timothy 2:22, Heb 10:22, 1 Peter 1:22. </strong></p>
<p>The one true God cannot be worshipped alongside fetishes and impious systems. The warning is at this moment given to humanity that they refrain from rendering homage, which only is due to God alone to the beast. The beast is the union of the Church and the state- the man of sin according to 2 Thessalonians 2;1-4. According to the prophet Daniel, the apostate religious and political system is called the little horn. Daniel 7:8, 20-25, 8:9-12. While the righteous will suffer for their fidelity to God because of the dragon's wrath-Satan Revelation 12:17, God in His sovereignty will intervene and preserve the loyal disciples or saints from eternal doom.</p>
<p>Conversely, God will employ the seven last plagues on the rebellious and the apostates. It will lead to the lake of fire, which will consume demons and the devil. Rev 15:16,20. As noted above, despite the theme of suffering in both good and evil camps, the outcome is different. God's worshippers will escape the dragon's wrath and stand as victors with the Lamb of God, Rev 14:1-5. The rebels die without hope of resurrection, as put in Rev 14;9, 10.</p>
<p>According to Ranko Stefanović in his book the <strong>Revelation of Jesus Christ </strong><em>commentary on the book of Revelation</em> second edition. It is clearly stated that "the execution of the wrath of God in the Old Testament is frequently symbolised by drinking wine from the Lord's cup. [Job 21:20, Ps 60:3, 75:8, Isa 51:17-23 Jer 25;15&hellip;&rdquo; The idea of fire and Sulphur with the smoke ascending "forever and ever" is drawn from the Old Testament&hellip;. the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah Gen 19;24. Isa 34:8-10, the phrase forever and ever does not mean endless burning. No fire burns today in Sodom and Gomorrah. However, the eternal fire was their allotment. The purpose of the fire is to consume, never to preserve. The phrase [ forever and ever] denotes a burning that lasts long enough to complete the consumption, with nothing left to be burned.</p>
<p>The smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever. It indicates the completion of the burning. It is the imagery indicating the completion of the final judgement rather than eternal burning and suffering. The burning fire continues long enough to complete its purpose and leaves nothing to be burned.</p>
<p>The wicked have no rest day or night. In Revelation 14:13, the saints find rest in Christ but not with the wicked. The rest into which God's people enter is eternal; so, the unrest of the impending judgment for the unbelievers is eternal. &hellip;. From this last judgement, there is no reprieve; the death sentence is irreversible; the destruction permits no recovery.</p>
<p><strong><em>"Here is the endurance of the saints, the ones who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from Heaven saying, "Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labours; for their works will follow them."</em></strong></p>
<p>The Remnants, to fulfil their mission mandate, are not prompted to protest and resist but are required to endure and persevere. In the context of worldwide apostasy and lawlessness, the Remnant -God's end-time people buffeted by false ideas, assaulted by religious confederacy, and threatened by the civil powers- remain steadfast and firm in their loyalty to God, pp 464.</p>
<p>The last phase of the Text seems to clear away all the chaff surrounding the reality of death. A misconception of death leads to spiritism and an unholy allegiance to the evil one. The righteous are not beyond the possibility of death. They, too, die. The blessing does not rest on them as dead but as living spirits in the spirit world, but rather in their possibility of rising to live again once the life giver commands the same. The works that follow them are not new works accomplished in the state of mortality but are the excellent results of good work accomplished while living. Faith in Jesus is the righteous saints' hope of glory.</p>
<p><strong>Having seen the importance of worship in the Third Angel's message, what things are you prepared to reform to make your devotional life livelier and growing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discuss the significance of judgement in the Third Angel's message and how we can take advantage of God's mercy in the probationary time when God's wrath is mixed with mercy. </strong></p>
<p><strong>According to the Third Angel's message, how does the judgement end the scourge of death, sin and corruption and put all else in eternal peace?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>All in all, evangelism is a divine mandate from God to humanity, especially the Church on Earth, because the Church exists for the Gospel and its proliferation into the world. The essence of evangelism is when Christ's presence is appreciated, and His grace is made available to those with the image of GOD universally. Knowing, worshipping, and obeying Christ will make salvation a blessed possibility. It is the sacred mandate of the Church- fulfilling its mission by revealing the redeemer and unfurling the glories of a transformative life<em>. </em>The Church's I will go initiative is consonant with lifting Jesus from the Earth.</p>
