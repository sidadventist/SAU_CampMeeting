<p>The rise of a plurality of biblical methodologies in the late 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> centuries has led to a cornucopia of theologies.</p>
<p>Accordingly, theological differences, tensions, and schisms have not only threatened long held traditional beliefs, but impacted the unity, identity, and mission of evangelical denominations.</p>
<p>Arguably, at the core of the above challenges, that seem not to go away anytime soon, is biblical hermeneutics/interpretation.</p>
<p>The rise and negative influence of the historical critical methodology cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Assumptions and presuppositions characterize methodologies selected for interpretation of the biblical text. <br />However, the option and/or merits of the biblical/historical grammatical methodology is available.</p>
<p>The task of biblical exploration must seek to remain rooted to sound biblical hermeneutics/interpretation, that uphold the biblical corpus as the word of God.</p>
<p>Human assumptions and presuppositions that are incongruent with <em>sola scriptura</em>, among other notable elements, must be surrendered in the process of exegetical exposition, irrespective of methodological selection. No scholar comes to the biblical text devoid of macro and/or micro hermeneutical assumptions, irrespective of methodological selection.</p>
<p>Regardless, biblical interpretation is a rigorous exercise, that lies at the foundation of all theological discourse.</p>
<p>Taking the above into consideration, this paper explores the&nbsp;(a) significance, (b) historical development, (c) principles, and (d) procedures of biblical hermeneutics/interpretation preferred for orthodoxy biblical exegetes, teachers, and preachers. Thus, exegetes, pastors or bible teachers will find the present study invaluable, reaffirming and refreshing.</p>
